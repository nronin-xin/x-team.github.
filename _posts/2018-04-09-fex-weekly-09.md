**Re-inventing npmjs.com**  
http://blog.npmjs.org/post/172567815935/re-inventing-npmjscom  
Last week, the npmjs.com website received the most ambitious update in its history. We said “cheerio” to the old hapi-and jQuery-based website, and “hello” to a state-of-the-art web application based on Spife and React.

**Examples of everything new in ECMAScript 2016, 2017, and 2018**

In this article, I’ll cover all 18 features that are listed in the TC39’s finished proposals that were added in ES2016, ES2017, and ES2018 (final draft) and show them with useful examples.

**GitLab + Google Cloud Platform = simplified, scalable deployment**  
https://about.gitlab.com/2018/04/05/gke-gitlab-integration/  
Get super-simple deployment for your app with GitLab and Google Cloud Platform (GCP): thanks to our integration with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), you can now get CI/CD and Kubernetes deployment set up with just a few clicks.. Now everyone can get automatic code quality, security testing, and no-configuration deployment.

**Improved Docker Container Integration with Java 10**  
https://blog.docker.com/2018/04/improved-docker-container-integration-with-java-10/  
With the release of Java 10, the JVM now recognizes constraints set by container control groups (cgroups). Both memory and cpu constraints can be used manage Java applications directly in containers, these include: adhering to memory limits set in the container; setting available cpus in the container; setting cpu constraints in the container. Java 10 improvements are realized in both Docker for Mac or Windows and Docker Enterprise Edition environments.

**当 Egg 遇到 TypeScript**

**F2 3.1 发布，开箱即用的移动端可视化解决方案**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/35209259  
F2，源于 Fast & Flexible 两个单词首字母，是 AntV 家族中专为移动端定制、开箱即用的可视化解决方案。或许大家对我比较陌生，但是从 AntV 上线的那一天起我就已经出道了，那时候我有另外一个名字『G2-mobile』，我和 G2 师承一脉，尽得『图形语法』真传，主要用于满足对代码体积以及渲染性能要求严苛的移动端图表需求。

**Node全栈为前端带来更多可能**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxMzcxMzE5Ng==&mid=2247488622&idx=1&sn=ace22c286a261645e2c07a7adf90abf9  
Node 为解决后端并发而生，但却无心插柳，成为大前端的基石。伴随大前端的发展，Node 也发展得越来越好，越来越重要，其应用场景从脚手架、辅助前端开发（比如 SSR、PWA 等）的快速开发实践，到 API 中间层、代理层，到专业的后端开发都有非常成熟的经验。另外，前端越来越复杂，后端服务化，今日的前端要面临更多的挑战，Node 全栈给大家更多可能，狼叔对此坚定不移。

**Scaling Uber’s Hadoop Distributed File System for Growth**  
https://eng.uber.com/scaling-hdfs/  
Scaling our infrastructure while maintaining high performance was no easy feat. To accomplish this, Uber’s Data Infrastructure team massively overhauled our approach to scaling our HDFS by implementing several new adjustments and features, including  View File System (ViewFs), frequent HDFS version upgrades, NameNode garbage collection tuning, limiting the number of small files that filter through the system, an HDFS load management service, and a read-only NameNode replica. Read on to learn how Uber implemented these improvements to facilitate the continued growth, stability, and reliability of our storage system.

**How Ipdata Serves 25M API Calls From 10 Infinitely Scalable Global Endpoints**  
http://highscalability.com/blog/2018/4/2/how-ipdata-serves-25m-api-calls-from-10-infinitely-scalable.html  
Our users typically call our API on each page request on their websites to geolocate their users and localize their content. So this particular failure was directly impacting our users’ websites on the biggest sales day of the year.  This sequence of events and their inexplicable nature — cpu, mem and i/o were nowhere near capacity. As well as concerns on how well (if at all) we would scale, given our outage, were a big wake up call to rethink our existing infrastructure.

**Updating the NGINX Application Platform**  
https://www.nginx.com/blog/updating-nginx-application-platform/  
Today, our vision to simplify the journey to microservices takes a big step forward. We are announcing the upcoming availability of the next version of our flagship software, NGINX Plus R15, with exciting new features, and the upcoming launches of NGINX Unit 1.0 and NGINX Controller R1. Combined, these launches advance the NGINX Application Platform, a product suite that includes a load balancer, content cache, API gateway, WAF, and application server – all with centralized monitoring and management for monolithic apps, for microservices, and for transitional apps.

**Introduction to Computer Vision**  
https://blog.algorithmia.com/introduction-to-computer-vision/  
Computer Vision is the process of using machines to understand and analyze imagery (both photos and videos). While these types of algorithms have been around in various forms since the 1960’s, recent advances in Machine Learning, as well as leaps forward in data storage, computing capabilities, and cheap high-quality input devices, have driven major improvements in how well our software can explore this kind of content.

**[译]关于日常生活中视觉标识的探索**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTQ2NzgwMw==&mid=2247487075&idx=1&sn=57cd886e0cf7b12621f1eff8a354ffd4  
视觉标示常能使某一产品从一堆产品中脱颖而出，这样看来，与其要求使用者进行操作行为，倒不如用些交流手段来给用户一些他们值得注意的暗示。标示物并不一直明确的存在但是它常在某个情况下以一种低调的暗示方式出现。标示物通过图标、排版样式、放大字体、颜色变化、动画以及其他一些表现形式来达到对外传递信息的目的。

**The Rise Of Intelligent Conversational UI**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/04/rise-intelligent-conversational-ui/  
The importance of Conversational UI cannot be understated, even if some of us wish it wasn’t happening. The most important advancement in Conversational UI has been Natural Language Processing (NLP). This is the field of computing that deals not with deciphering the exact words that a user said, but with parsing out of it their actual intent. If the bot is the interface, NLP is the brain. In this article, we’re going to take a look at why NLP is so important, and how you (yes, you!) can build your own.

**The Inside Story of Reddit's Redesign**  
https://www.wired.com/story/reddit-redesign/  
For the past year and a half, Reddit and its new team of 20 designers have been refashioning the so-called "front page of the internet." They've taken great pains to build on top of Reddit's long legacy, rather than replacing it with something unfamiliar. They've argued about everything from the placement of the logo to the way moderators should style their communities to the dominant color on the site (red-orange, as it turns out). It's been a slow, careful process that everyone takes extremely seriously. "If you redesign Reddit," says Diego Perez, the company's head of design, "you're inherently changing the internet."

**Introducing Network Error Logging**  
https://dcreager.net/nel/intro/  
Enter Network Error Logging (NEL), a new web platform spec that we’re working on in the W3C’s Web Performance Working Group. With NEL, you can instruct user agents to collect the same set of information that would appear in your server logs. Those instructions would apply to all requests to your server’s origin, regardless of how (and on which containing sites) those requests were initiated. And since the data is collected directly by the user agent, you should have visibility into all of your clients’ connection requests, not just those that made it to your serving infrastructure.

**The End of Windows**  
https://stratechery.com/2018/the-end-of-windows/  
The story of Windows’ decline is relatively straightforward and a classic case of disruption: The Internet dramatically reduced application lock-in; PCs became “good enough”, elongating the upgrade cycle; Smartphones first addressed needs the PC couldn’t, then over time started taking over PC functionality directly. Thus my assertion at the top, that the story of how Microsoft came to accept the reality of Windows’ decline is more interesting than the fact of Windows’ decline; this is how CEO Satya Nadella convinced the company to accept the obvious.
