**The Economics of Writing a Technical Book**  
https://medium.com/@rothgar/the-economics-of-writing-a-technical-book-689d0c12fe39    
I am not an expert. I have co-authored a single book in 2017 called Cloud Native Infrastructure for O’Reilly Media. Many people have asked me what it was like so I will attempt to explain the process, time investment, and financial incentive here. This was my experience. If you have written a book, or would like to, I promise your experience will be different. Nonetheless, I hope you can learn something from the things I learned.

**Welcome to the immersive web**  
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/welcome-to-immersive    
The immersive web means virtual world experiences hosted through the browser. This covers entire virtual reality (VR) experiences surfaced in the browser or in VR enabled headsets like Google's Daydream, Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR, HTC Vive, and Windows Mixed Reality Headsets, as well as augmented reality experiences developed for AR-enabled mobile devices.

**Why Flutter Will Change Mobile Development for the Best**  
https://proandroiddev.com/why-flutter-will-change-mobile-development-for-the-best-c249f71fa63c    
If you’re an Android developer, you may have heard of Flutter. It’s a relatively new, supposedly simple framework designed for making cross-platform native apps. It’s not the first of its kind, but it’s being used by Google, giving its claims some credence. Despite my initial reservations upon hearing about it, I decided on a whim to give it a chance — and it dramatically changed my outlook on mobile development within a weekend. Here is what I learned. 附：[Building a mobile frontend for a Go application using Flutter](https://sites.google.com/a/athaydes.com/renato-athaydes/posts/buildingamobilefrontendforagoapplicationusingflutter)

**Supporting React Native at Pinterest**  
https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/supporting-react-native-at-pinterest-f8c2233f90e6    
Early last year, a small group of engineers started investigating the possibility of adopting React Native at Pinterest. We’ve been following the ecosystem with interest since it was first open-sourced in 2015. Since then, a robust community has developed around it, and it’s been integrated by companies across the industry. We decided to take a serious look at what the business case is for using this technology at Pinterest.

**my struggle to learn react**  
http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/my-struggle-to-learn-react/    
I’m going to be honest: I’ve had a hell of a time getting my head around React. More than any other technology I’ve touched over the last 10 years of my career, I just haven’t had it click for me. It’s very frustrating as I really want to learn it, and it’s clear the library has legs. 附：[A response “my Struggle to learn react”](https://medium.com/@andrewingram/a-response-my-struggle-to-learn-react-9b688dc68fab)

**前端工程师的技术进阶点在哪里?**

**Google YOLO clickjacking**  
http://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/2018-05-11.html    
YOLO (You Only Login Once) is a web widget for "One-tap sign-up and auto sign-in on websites" by Google. You embed Google provided iframe on your websites and your users can authenticate with their Google account in one simple click. Ironically, "web widgets" and "one click" is indeed YOLO (You Only Live Once). Remember the cookie consent button you clicked at the very beginning? That's right, it was a Clickjacking attempt :).

**`npm audit`: identify and fix insecure dependencies**  
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/173719309445/npm-audit-identify-and-fix-insecure

**Server side architecture with Node and Typescript using Nest**  
https://samueleresca.net/2018/02/server-side-architecture-with-node-and-typescript-with-nest/    
The modularity may become a problem when you want to follow an specific architecture or patterns. That kind of problem raise when you are involved on large-scale projects with distributed teams. Well, I have found the solution in [Nest](https://nestjs.com/), which provide out-of-box a server side architecture with Node and Typescript.

**The Various Kinds of IO - Blocking, Non-blocking, Multiplexed and Async**  
https://www.rubberducking.com/2018/05/the-various-kinds-of-io-blocking-non.html    
I've found it was particularly hard to demystify the various kinds of IO that are now offered to software programmers. There is a lot of confusion out there about what are the differences between blocking, non-blocking, multiplexed and async IO. So I thought I'd give a shot at clarifying what each of these kind of IO entails.

**SRE vs. DevOps: competing standards or close friends?**  
https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/05/SRE-vs-DevOps-competing-standards-or-close-friends.html    
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and DevOps are two trending disciplines with quite a bit of overlap. In the past, some have called SRE a competing set of practices to DevOps. But we think they're not so different after all.

**Google Duplex: An AI System for Accomplishing Real-World Tasks Over the Phone**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html    
A new technology for conducting natural conversations to carry out “real world” tasks over the phone. The technology is directed towards completing specific tasks, such as scheduling certain types of appointments. For such tasks, the system makes the conversational experience as natural as possible, allowing people to speak normally, like they would to another person, without having to adapt to a machine.

**What’s new in Material Design?**

**Top UX Inspirations of all time!**  
https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/top-ui-inspirations-of-all-time-90cb37c61c45    
Good UI design facilitates making the completion of tasks as frictionless as possible and increasing usability. Good design is like a refrigerator — when it works, no one notices, but when it doesn’t, it sure stinks.

**UX Design Glossary: How to Use Affordances in User Interfaces**  
https://uxplanet.org/ux-design-glossary-how-to-use-affordances-in-user-interfaces-393c8e9686e4    
Affordance is a property or feature of an object which presents a prompt on what can be done with this object. In short, affordances are cues which give a hint how users may interact with something, no matter physical or digital. For example, when you see a door handle, it is a prompt you can use it to open the door. When you see a receiver icon, it gives you a hint you may click it to make a call. Affordances make our life easier as they support our successful interactions with the world of physical things and virtual objects.

**Tech’s Two Philosophies**  
https://stratechery.com/2018/techs-two-philosophies/    
Tech’s Yin and Yang. That there are two philosophies does not necessarily mean that one is right and one is wrong: the reality is we need both. Some problems are best solved by human ingenuity, enabled by the likes of Microsoft and Apple; others by collective action. That, though, gets at why Google and Facebook are fundamentally more dangerous: collective action is traditionally the domain of governments, the best form of which is bounded by the popular will. Google and Facebook, on the other hand, are accountable to no one. Both deserve all of the recent scrutiny they have attracted, and arguably deserve more.

**From extraction to empowerment: a better future for data for development**  
https://webfoundation.org/2018/05/from-extraction-to-empowerment-a-better-future-for-data-for-development/    
During Open Government Week we’ve been thinking about what needs to be done to put citizens at the center of data initiatives in a way that gives them meaningful influence in the decisions that affect their daily lives.

**同理心：个人、产品及组织的永恒竞争力**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI5MjMyNjk2Mg==&mid=2247489179&idx=1&sn=d0adfa38e9e952f3e9c3b336bdf75e85    
过去，我们习惯于将科学分为自然科学与社会科学，这是工业时代思维的产物。随着智能时代的来临，界限明确的学科分类方式引发了诸多的问题。智能产品已经不再是单纯的技术产物，它要求与用户产生良好的互动，而不再是执行人们给出的命令。如果一个产品设计人员没有很好的同理心，他就无法设计出一款有竞争力的好产品。

**雷军：我这十年来的思考**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/S5SMQUyYT3Ln45sXb6MQqQ    
那些成功做出独角兽企业的创业者，这类的人大多都是天生的，他们非常清楚自己想要什么，可以为了等这个机会，默默付出别人难以想象的代价，最后就只是为了这一仗。

**警惕停留在优秀的诱惑，这是卓越最大的敌人**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI0NzY3Mjc0Mw==&mid=2247484724&idx=1&sn=5c2417a28ca950f3bdc695aac4a3a4fe    
在创业的过程中，很多公司容易滑入优秀的“陷阱”中，去实现那些清晰目标，获得成就的快感，然而在这些成功中投入努力、获得认可，你可能离一家卓越的公司越来越远。追求卓越充满了挫败，但这个过程本身就会让你和企业无法替代。
