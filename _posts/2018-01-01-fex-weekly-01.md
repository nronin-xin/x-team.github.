**Top JavaScript Libraries & Tech to Learn in 2018**  
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-libraries-tech-to-learn-in-2018-c38028e028e6  
Last year, I wrote an article rounding up the top tech to learn in 2017. This year there are some surprises. First, software ate the world, the web ate software, and JavaScript ate the web. In 2018, React is eating JavaScript.

**The Node.js Community was amazing in 2017!**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/awesome-node-js-tutorials-from-2017-collection/  
2017 was a great year for the Node.js Community! Not only the developers who contribute to Node make this platform so great, but those who create learning materials around it were also exceptional.

**Vue.js vs React in 2017: state of art**  
http://pixeljets.com/blog/vue-js-vs-react-what-to-expect-in-2018/  
Vue.js is clearly the leader in "would like to learn" by a huge margin which makes me think the next year would be the year of Vue.js success, with React being stable in its growth, while Angular won't be able to keep up with these two rivals. Compare it with 2016 when Vue.js was clearly a dark horse and "another JS framework", Angular was a second choice for "serious guys" and React was a leader.

**Ant Design 色板生成算法演进之路**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/32422584  
确定” 作为 Ant Design 的设计理念之一，在调色板这一隅发挥得淋漓尽致：用科学定义设计，在设计有迹可循的同时提高了代码的可维护性，减少开发阶段样式代码的不确定性。Ant Design 三个大版本的色板生成算法各不相同，却一直在完善，本文对其三个版本的色板生成算法进行解读，聊一聊我的体会。

**A Tinder Progressive Web App Performance Case Study**  
https://medium.com/@addyosmani/a-tinder-progressive-web-app-performance-case-study-78919d98ece0  
Tinder recently swiped right on the web. Their new responsive Progressive Web App — Tinder Online — is available to 100% of users on desktop and mobile, employing techniques for JavaScript performance optimization, Service Workers for network resilience and Push Notifications for chat engagement.

**No boundaries for user identities: Web trackers exploit browser login managers**  
https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2017/12/27/no-boundaries-for-user-identities-web-trackers-exploit-browser-login-managers/  
In this second installment of the No Boundaries series, we show how a long-known vulnerability in browsers’ built-in password managers is abused by third-party scripts for tracking on more than a thousand sites.

**Why TLS 1.3 isn't in browsers yet**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-tls-1-3-isnt-in-browsers-yet/  
The reductive answer to why TLS 1.3 hasn’t been deployed yet is middleboxes: network appliances designed to monitor and sometimes intercept HTTPS traffic inside corporate environments and mobile networks. Some of these middleboxes implemented TLS 1.2 incorrectly and now that’s blocking browsers from releasing TLS 1.3. The deeper truth of the story is that TLS 1.3, as it was originally designed, was incompatible with the way the Internet has evolved over time. How and why this happened is the multifaceted question I will be exploring in this blog post.

**Advanced Numpy Techniques**  
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vlad17/np-learn/blob/master/presentation.ipynb  
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is an open-source package that's part of the SciPy ecosystem. Its main feature is an array object of arbitrary dimension, but this fundamental collection is integral to any data-focused Python application. Most people learn numpy through assimilation or necessity. I believe NumPy has the latter learning curve (steep/easy to learn), so you can actually invest just a little bit of time now (by going through this notebook, for instance), and reap a lot of reward!

**Building a Distributed Log from Scratch**  
https://bravenewgeek.com/building-a-distributed-log-from-scratch-part-2-data-replication/

## 新鲜货

**New Package Moniker rules**  
http://blog.npmjs.org/post/168978377570/new-package-moniker-rules  
Package names can include punctuation like dots, dashes, and underscores (., -, _). Punctuation can make package names readable! For example react-native is a more readable name than reactnative would be. However, many typosquat names either accidentally or on purpose use punctuation differences to sneak through. For example, until this change it was possible to typosquat react-native by publishing reactnative. Under our new naming rules, however, this is disallowed.

**A Sneak-Peek Inside The Southeast Asian Web Community**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/on-the-road-with-mozilla/  
A few weeks ago, Vitaly Friedman (co-founder of this little magazine) and I had the pleasure to join Mozilla’s Developer Roadshow, traveling through four countries in Southeast Asia in just two weeks. We visited cities that are buzzing with life and met people who share our passion for the web. Our mission: To get up close with the Southeast Asian web community. We wanted to learn how different local communities are compared to Europe and the US. What can we learn from them? And what feels familiar?

**One-on-one meetings are underrated, whereas group meetings waste time**  
http://www.smashcompany.com/business/one-on-one-meetings-are-underrated-whereas-group-meetings-waste-time  
I have had good results with a style of management where I mostly have one-on-one meetings. These meetings can be just 15 minutes, or maybe 30 if there is a serious issue that needs to be discussed. If I’m leading a small team (less than 20 people) I’ll have meetings with each person at least once a week, but with key players more often than that.
