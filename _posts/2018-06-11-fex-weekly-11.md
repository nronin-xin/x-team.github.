**Microsoft + GitHub = Empowering Developers**  
https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/  
We announced an agreement to acquire GitHub, the world’s leading software development platform. I want to share what this acquisition will mean for our industry and for developers. The era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge is upon us. Computing is becoming embedded in the world, with every part of our daily life and work and every aspect of our society and economy being transformed by digital technology. Developers are the builders of this new era, writing the world’s code. And GitHub is their home. 附：GitHub 创始人的 [A bright future for GitHub](https://blog.github.com/2018-06-04-github-microsoft/)、[GitLab sees huge spike in project imports](https://monitor.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/github-importer?orgId=1)、[GitLab Ultimate and Gold now free for education and open source](https://about.gitlab.com/2018/06/05/gitlab-ultimate-and-gold-free-for-education-and-open-source/)、[The Cost of Developers](https://stratechery.com/2018/the-cost-of-developers/)

**You Probably Don't Need Derived State**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html  
React 16.4 included a bugfix for getDerivedStateFromProps which caused some existing bugs in React components to reproduce more consistently. If this release exposed a case where your application was using an anti-pattern and didn’t work properly after the fix, we’re sorry for the churn. In this post, we will explain some common anti-patterns with derived state and our preferred alternatives.

**10 Things I Regret About Node.js - Ryan Dahl - JSConf EU 2018**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA  
It's a great talk about Node and he also goes into some details about his new project Deno, a secure TypeScript runtime on V8. Here's some of the things he regrets: dynamic languages are great for certain things. In a server though, you want things to be statically typed. (Probably why he wrote Deno in TypeScript and Go); design mistakes: didn't stick with Promises in Node (in the beginning), keeping them could have sped up async/await development, security, Build system (GYP), package.json.

**G6 2.0 开源发布**  
https://yuque.com/antv/blog/g6-2.0-release

**Keeping Node.js Fast: Tools, Techniques, And Tips For Making High-Performance Node.js Servers**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/nodejs-tools-techniques-performance-servers/  
If you’ve been building anything with Node.js for long enough, then you’ve no doubt experienced the pain of unexpected speed issues. JavaScript is an evented, asynchronous language. That can make reasoning about performance tricky, as will become apparent. The surging popularity of Node.js has exposed the need for tooling, techniques and thinking suited to the constraints of server-side JavaScript. When it comes to performance, what works in the browser doesn’t necessarily suit Node.js. So, how do we make sure a Node.js implementation is fast and fit for purpose? Let’s walk through a hands-on example.

**Overscripted! Digging into JavaScript execution at scale**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/06/overscripted-digging-into-javascript-execution-at-scale/  
we set out to explore the unseen or otherwise not obvious series of JavaScript execution events that are triggered once a user visits a webpage, and all the first- and third-party events that are set in motion when people retrieve content. To help enable more exploration and analysis, we are providing our full set of data about JavaScript executions open source. The following sections will introduce the data set, how it was collected and the decisions made along the way. We’ll share examples of insights we’ve discovered and we’ll provide information on how to participate in the associated “Overscripted Web: A Mozilla Data Analysis Challenge”, which we’ve launched today with Mozilla’s Open Innovation Team.

**AI at Google: our principles**  
https://blog.google/topics/ai/ai-principles/  
We recognize that such powerful technology raises equally powerful questions about its use. How AI is developed and used will have a significant impact on society for many years to come. As a leader in AI, we feel a deep responsibility to get this right. So today, we’re announcing seven principles to guide our work going forward. These are not theoretical concepts; they are concrete standards that will actively govern our research and product development and will impact our business decisions. We acknowledge that this area is dynamic and evolving, and we will approach our work with humility, a commitment to internal and external engagement, and a willingness to adapt our approach as we learn over time.

**Lessons from Building Observability Tools at Netflix**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/lessons-from-building-observability-tools-at-netflix-7cfafed6ab17  
We tackle that challenge by developing observability tools and infrastructure to measure customers’ experiences and analyze those measurements to derive meaningful insights and higher-level conclusions from raw data. By observability, we mean analysis of logs, traces, and metrics. In this post, we share the following lessons we have learned.

**StatePoint Liquid Cooling System: A new, more efficient way to cool a data center**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/1221779261291831/statepoint-liquid-cooling-system-a-new-more-efficient-way-to-cool-a-data-center/  
Facebook data centers are some of the most advanced energy- and water-efficient facilities in the world. By cooling our facilities with outdoor air and using efficient cooling strategies such as our direct evaporative cooling system, our data centers use 50 percent less water than a typical data center. To achieve these results, we employ a variety of cooling strategies tailored to the specific environmental considerations for each data center. 另附：[Under the sea, Microsoft tests a datacenter that’s quick to deploy, could provide internet connectivity for years](https://news.microsoft.com/features/under-the-sea-microsoft-tests-a-datacenter-thats-quick-to-deploy-could-provide-internet-connectivity-for-years/).

This first part of the series focuses on building a query understanding engine for Uber Eats through an in-house food knowledge graph, and the related work done to help understand explicit eater intent through representation learning-based query expansion.

**Go for Industrial Programming**  
https://peter.bourgon.org/go-for-industrial-programming/  
I’m speaking today about programming in an industrial context. By that I mean: in a startup or corporate environment; within a team where engineers come and go; on code that outlives any single engineer; and serving highly mutable business requirements. This describes my work environments for most recent memory. I suspect it does for a lot of you, too. And the best advice for Go in this context is sometimes different than for Go in personal projects, or large open-source libraries, and so on.

**Chatbots were the next big thing**  
https://blog.growthbot.org/chatbots-were-the-next-big-thing-what-happened  
At the Mobile World Congress 2017, chatbots were the main headliners. The conference organizers cited an ‘overwhelming acceptance at the event of the inevitable shift of focus for brands and corporates to chatbots’. In fact, the only significant question around chatbots was who would monopolize the field, not whether chatbots would take off in the first place: “Will a single platform emerge to dominate the chatbot and personal assistant ecosystem?” One year on, we have an answer to that question. No. Because there isn’t even an ecosystem for a platform to dominate.
