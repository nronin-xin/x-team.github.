https://medium.com/@bluepnume/introducing-paypals-open-source-cross-domain-javascript-suite-95f991b2731d  
At PayPal we write a lot of javascript that ends up running on other websites and other domains.

**How Facebook's Instagram Acquisition Led To The Open Sourcing of React.js**  
https://stackshare.io/posts/the-react-story  
For the latest episode of Stack Stories, we did something a bit different. We decided to focus on the origin story of the one of the most popular technologies in the software development world: React. We sat down with Pete Hunt, one of the original creators of React, now CEO at Smyte, to get the untold, in-depth story of why React was first created, how it gained adoption within Facebook due to the Instagram acquisition, and it's eventual release to the public.

**写在2017的前端数据层不完全指北**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/30050350  
关于前端数据层的讨论依然在持续升温。不论数据类型层面的 TypeScript，Flow，PropTypes，应用架构层面的 MVC，MVP，MVVM，还是应用状态层面的 Redux，MobX，RxJS，都各自拥有一群忠实的拥趸，却又谁都无法说服对方认同自己的观点。关于技术选型上的讨论，笔者一直所持的态度都是求同存异。在讨论上述方案差异的文章已汗牛充栋的今天，不如让我们暂且放缓脚步，再回头去看一下这些方案所要解决的共同问题，并试图给出一些最简单的解法。

**The Story of CSS Grid, from Its Creators**  
https://alistapart.com/article/the-story-of-css-grid-from-its-creators  
On October 17th, Microsoft’s Edge browser shipped its implementation of CSS Grid. This is a milestone for a number of reasons. First, it means that all major browsers now support this incredible layout tool. Second, it means that all major browsers rolled out their implementations in a single year(!), a terrific example of standards success and cross-browser collaboration. But third, and perhaps most interestingly, it closes the loop on a process that has been more than 20 years in the making. 另附：[A Look Back at the History of CSS](https://css-tricks.com/look-back-history-css/).

**My 20-Year Experience of Software Development Methodologies**  
https://zwischenzugs.wordpress.com/2017/10/15/my-20-year-experience-of-software-development-methodologies/  
Lean, Agile, Waterfall, whatever, the fact is we need some kind of common ideology to co-operate in large numbers. None of them are evil, so it’s not like you’re picking racism over socialism or something. Whichever one you pick is not going to reflect the reality, but if you expect perfection you will be disappointed. And watch yourself for unspoken or unarticulated collective fictions. Your life is full of them. Like that your opinion is important.

**Mocking is a Code Smell**  
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a  
One of the biggest complaints I hear about TDD and unit tests is that people struggle with all of the mocking required to isolate units. Some people struggle to understand how their unit tests are even meaningful. In fact, I’ve seen developers get so lost in mocks, fakes, and stubs that they wrote entire files of unit tests where no actual implementation code was exercised at all. Oops.

**Building a Python monorepo for fast, reliable development**  
https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/building-a-python-monorepo-for-fast-reliable-development-be763781f67  
In this post, we’ll share a few challenges we encountered managing Python code at scale, and how Python commons provides a fast and reliable code development environment.

**Why we switched from Python to Go**  
https://getstream.io/blog/switched-python-go/  
Switching to a new language is always a big step, especially when only one of your team members has prior experience with that language. Early this year, we switched Stream’s primary programming language from Python to Go. This post will explain some of the reasons why we decided to leave Python behind and make the switch to Go.

**Vim After 15 Years**  
https://statico.github.io/vim3.html  
Vim 8 added a lot of much-needed functionality, and new community sites like [VimAwesome](https://vimawesome.com/) have made plugin discovery and evaluation easier. I’ve been doing a lot more work with Vim lately and have spent some time configuring my workflow for peak efficiency, so here’s a snapshot of my current state.

**Google and the Resurgence of Italian Design**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/google-and-the-resurgence-of-italian-design-e9234cf3d073  
Google’s emerging design language (obviously still a work in progress) is reminiscent of the Italian branch of industrial design, which we haven’t seen much of in the last two or three decades. Instead, it’s been the German branch that has dominated, characterized by clean geometric shapes (cubes, cylinders), white and black glossy colors, and smooth unadorned surfaces.

**A new study shows that students learn way more effectively from print textbooks than screens**  
http://www.businessinsider.com/students-learning-education-print-textbooks-screens-study-2017-10  
As researchers in learning and text comprehension, our recent work has focused on the differences between reading print and digital media. While new forms of classroom technology like digital textbooks are more accessible and portable, it would be wrong to assume that students will automatically be better served by digital reading simply because they prefer it.

**How Social Media Endangers Knowledge**  
https://www.wired.com/story/wikipedias-fate-shows-how-the-web-endangers-knowledge/  
WIKIPEDIA, ONE OF the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web, is in existential crisis. Now the challenge is to save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know. Television has even infected Wikipedia itself—today many of the most popular entries tend to revolve around television series or their cast.

一旦手机不在身边，就会特别焦虑，生怕错过了重要事情，就算没事随手翻两下也好。现在，这样的场景一直在我们身边上演。不仅作为普通人的我们离不开手机和社交媒体，不少硅谷精英们也难戒网瘾。不过，那些让技术变成“毒品”一样令人上瘾的谷歌、推特和 Facebook 工程师们，正在尝试将自己和互联网隔离开来，开始主动戒网戒手机。

由 MacTalk 君打造的极客时间：2017年7月31日，我们发布了一款给程序员使用的搜索引擎「极客搜索」，深得技术人员的喜爱。两个多月过去了，今天我们团队为技术人发布了一款新产品，产品的名字叫做「极客时间」。附耗子哥在这个应用的一篇文章：[程序员是手艺人，如何让自己的技能变现](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIwNjQwMzUwMQ==&mid=2247485520&idx=1&sn=708eaee7c6f534f1f773876f54d13b58)。

美国设计公司Signs采访了150多人，邀请他们尽可能准确的画出记忆中的10个著名品牌Logo。从1500张、总耗时达80小时的画作里，总结出了一些有趣的数据。事实显示，这些看似无处不在的标识在大家心中其实非常模糊。
