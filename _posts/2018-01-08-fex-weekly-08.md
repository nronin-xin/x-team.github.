https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/front-end-performance-checklist-2018-pdf-pages/

It can be loaded in an asynchronous way that will not delay the page load even if boomerang.js is unavailable. This post will perform an honest audit of the entire “cost” of Boomerang on a page that it is measuring.

https://begriffs.com/posts/2017-04-13-longterm-computing-reading.html  
The books here are emphatically not about “cracking” coding interviews, or any other demonstrative brainteasing. It’s all about intrinsically interesting things. I’ve also omitted the usual suspects like SICP, TAOCP or CLRS – my choice of books are higher-level. They are guides for jumping into fun deep hacks.
