**The State of JavaScript 2017**  
https://stateofjs.com/2017/introduction/  
另附：[A recap of front-end development in 2017](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-recap-of-front-end-development-in-2017-7072ce99e727)、[Interesting Web Application Development Trends in 2018](https://dzone.com/articles/top-10-web-application-development-trends-in-2018)、[11 Vue.js Component Libraries You Should Know In 2018](https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/12/google-managers) 

**2017 Year in review: Software across the stack**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/874627342705873/2017-year-in-review-software-across-the-stack/  
This week we're publishing a series of posts looking back at the technologies and advancements Facebook engineers introduced in 2017. Read our previous posts from this week about [data centers](https://code.facebook.com/posts/392743124493876/2017-year-in-review-data-centers/), [connectivity](https://code.facebook.com/posts/524494194591856/2017-year-in-review-better-global-networks/), and [building immersive experiences](https://code.facebook.com/posts/471099566618454/2017-year-in-review-building-immersive-experiences/).

**React - Improving the Repository Infrastructure**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/12/15/improving-the-repository-infrastructure.html  
As we worked on React 16, we revamped the folder structure and much of the build tooling in the React repository. Among other things, we introduced projects such as Rollup, Prettier, and Google Closure Compiler into our workflow. People often ask us questions about how we use those tools. In this post, we would like to share some of the changes that we’ve made to our build and test infrastructure in 2017, and what motivated them.

**JavaScript code coverage**  
https://v8project.blogspot.jp/2017/12/javascript-code-coverage.html  
Earlier this year, we added native support for JavaScript code coverage to V8. The initial release in version 5.9 provided coverage at function granularity (showing which functions have been executed), which was later extended to support coverage at block granularity in 6.2 (likewise, but for individual expressions).

**The Current State of Implementation and Planning for ESModules**  
https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/the-current-state-of-implementation-and-planning-for-esmodules-a4ecb2aac07a  
ESModules have been shipping in Node.js since version 8.9.0, you need to use the flag —-experimental-modules to utilize it. Parts of our implementation have been controversial and received push back from the community. As the implementation of ESM has a number of moving parts, including how we plan to support interoperability, the Node.js TSC thought it would be a good idea to get our current design decisions on paper to share with the general community.

**REST is the new SOAP**  
https://medium.com/@pakaldebonchamp/rest-is-the-new-soap-97ff6c09896d  
For decades, about every programming language has functioned with the same workflow: sending inputs to a callable, and getting results or errors as output. This worked well. Quite well. With Rest, this has turned into an insane work of mapping apples to oranges, and praising HTTP specifications to better violate them minutes later.

**Internet protocols are changing**  
https://blog.apnic.net/2017/12/12/internet-protocols-changing/  
Significant changes to the core Internet protocols are underway. While they are intended to be compatible with the Internet at large (since they won’t get adoption otherwise), they might be disruptive to those who have taken liberties with undocumented aspects of protocols or made an assumption that things won’t change.

**Node.js 中遇到含空格 URL 的神奇“Bug”——小范围深入 HTTP 协议**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/31966196
本文探索基于了一个有空格非正常的 URI 通过 CURL 或者其它一些客户端请求时，Node.js 出现的 Bug 状态。

**表格边框你知多少**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MTEwNTM0ODI0MQ==&mid=2653434985&idx=1&sn=b33f2b159b1f8317163f9f6ef17cb12f  
table之间的边框存在共用问题，自然而然就存在冲突。既然存在冲突，那么就势必涉及到最后渲染哪一个样式的问题。本文就主要研究当冲突产生时，如何让浏览器按照自己意愿渲染冲突边框。在这篇文章中都有介绍，以及对表格的边框渲染原理进行了深度的剖析

**Why VSCode is better than Atom?**  
http://teahour.fm/2017/12/12/why-vscode-is-better-than-atom.html  
VSCode Team 的一线开发人员 Peng Lyu 分享为什么 VScode 比 Atom 快这么多？

**Understanding CSS Layout And The Block Formatting Context**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/understanding-css-layout-block-formatting-context/  
In this article, I’ll explain what a BFC is through examples which are likely to be familiar to you. I’ll then show you a new value of display, that really only makes sense once you understand what a BFC is and why you might need one.

**Atomic Design with React**  
https://cheesecakelabs.com/blog/atomic-design-react/  
Atomic Design helps to build consistent, solid and reusable design systems. Plus, in the world of React, Vue and frameworks that stimulate the componentization, Atomic Design is used unconsciously; but when used in the right way, it becomes a powerful ally for developers.

**Design Systems and CSS Grid**  
https://24ways.org/2017/design-systems-and-css-grid/  
From prototyping this new grid and components in CSS Grid, I’ve found it a fantastic way to reimagine how we can create a layout or grid system for our sites. It gives us options to create the same layouts in differing ways that could suit a project and its needs. 另附：[Why Design Systems Fail](https://24ways.org/2017/why-design-systems-fail/) 

**Scaling design: The start of system thinking**  
https://about.gitlab.com/2017/12/12/gitlab-design-library/  
How we began the process of introducing a design system to GitLab. Scaling design within an application is a struggle. Design systems help alleviate problems that arise with scaling by making it easier to find inconsistent interactions or conflicting messaging. However, it can be extremely difficult to introduce a new system to teams that are already functioning without one. Here's how we got started.

**A TOUR OF CONTAINERD 1.0**  
https://blog.docker.com/2017/12/containerd-ga-features-2/  
Containerd is used by Docker, Kubernetes CRI, and a few other projects but this is a post for people who may not know what containerd actually does within these platforms.  I would like to do more posts on the feature set and design of containerd in the future but for now, we will start with the basics. 另附：[Kubernetes 1.9 and a look inside the Kubernetes project](https://coreos.com/blog/kubernetes-19-and-a-look-inside-the-project)

**Building Services at Airbnb, Part 1**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/building-services-at-airbnb-part-1-c4c1d8fa811b  
In this post, we share what we have designed and built to scale the development of services — using the same number engineer-hours to build more backend services that are more robust, performant, and easier to maintain. 

**Netflix: What Happens When You Press Play?**  
http://highscalability.com/blog/2017/12/11/netflix-what-happens-when-you-press-play.html  
Netflix seems so simple. Press play and video magically appears. Easy, right? Not so much. Given our discussion in the What is Cloud Computing? chapter, you might expect Netflix to serve video using AWS. Press play in a Netflix application and video stored in S3 would be streamed from S3, over the internet, directly to your device.

**Server-side I/O Performance: Node vs. PHP vs. Java vs. Go**  
https://www.toptal.com/back-end/server-side-io-performance-node-php-java-go  
In this article, we’ll be comparing Node, Java, Go, and PHP with Apache, discussing how the different languages model their I/O, the advantages and disadvantages of each model, and conclude with some rudimentary benchmarks. If you’re concerned about the I/O performance of your next web application, this article is for you.

**High-level Problems with Git and How to Fix Them**  
https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2017/12/11/high-level-problems-with-git-and-how-to-fix-them/  
In this post, I'll be talking about some high-level, high-impact problems with Git and possible solutions for them. My primary goal of this post is to foster positive change in Git and the services around it. The staging area is a feature that should not be enabled in the default Git configuration. Branches and Remotes Management is Complex and Time-Consuming. Forks aren't the Model You are Looking For.

**为什么美团总是看起来四处受敌**

设计就是分类，如果按照这个方法论对中国互联网整个产业进行分类，可以分为两类：A类是供给和履约在线上，B类是供给和履约在线下。在这其中，B类又可以分为：以SKU为中心的供给B1和以Location为中心的服务B2。B2是2012年到现在为止中国互联网竞争最激烈的领域。

**傅盛：生物学思维给我的四个启示**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5NjgzMzkwMQ==&mid=2653646444&idx=1&sn=aa5260ff03208b3f85f06ee3128816cc  
相比物理学等自然科学，生物学更深刻地揭示了世界的底层规律，其思想放之四海而皆准。它向我们展示了一个可能我们自己都并不了解的真实世界。这个世界看上去生机勃勃，其实背后的规律，冰冷，残酷。进化论真正的价值在于，让我们意识到每个人的自我，都会认为自己是特殊的；如果不是认为自己特殊，就不会因为自己遇到了一些挫折而感觉受到了伤害。其实这都是因为你自己的、以自我为中心的幻象。生物学的思维模型给带来了四个很重要的思考启示：第一，混沌。第二，理性。第三，过程。第四，反脆弱。另附搜狗的王小川从生命的复杂性中所得到的启发：[是什么让搜狗活到今天](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5ODMzMDkzOA==&mid=2661084131&idx=1&sn=1ec024858b9ad0ad8f783414c15e133e)
