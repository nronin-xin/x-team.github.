**V8 - Improved code caching**  
https://v8project.blogspot.com/2018/04/improved-code-caching.html  
V8 uses code caching to cache the generated code for frequently-used scripts. Starting with Chrome 66, we are caching more code by generating the cache after top-level execution. This leads to a 20-40% reduction in parse and compilation time during the initial load.

https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/04/css-at-scale\-\-linkedins-new-open-source-projects-take-on-stylesh  
[CSS Blocks](https://github.com/linkedin/css-blocks) is an ergonomic, component-oriented CSS authoring system that compiles to high-performance stylesheets. By combining an opinionated authoring system, build-time analysis and rewriting of templates, and a new type of CSS optimizer, css-blocks breathes new power and ease of use into the technologies and best practices that stylesheet developers already know and love.

**Testing Strategies for React and Redux**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/04/testing-strategies-for-react-and-redux/  
When the Firefox Add-ons team ported addons.mozilla.org to a single page app backed by an API, we chose React and Redux for powerful state management, delightful developer tools, and testability. Achieving the testability part isn’t completely obvious since there are competing tools and techniques. Below are some testing strategies that are working really well for us. 另附：[Software Testing Anti-patterns](http://blog.codepipes.com/testing/software-testing-antipatterns.html) 

**Nerv实战 - 京东首页改版小结**  
https://aotu.io/notes/2018/04/24/jdindex_2017/  
从 整体开发架构与模式，性能、体验优化的探索，页面可用性的保障等方面对京东首页的开发过程做了 简单的介绍。之所以说简单，是因为短短的篇幅完全无法说完我们在开发期间的故事和感悟：许多问题的解决并不像上面讲的那样水到渠成；除此之外更是有一大堆深夜加班撸串的故事没有地方讲。

**Qone 正式开源，使 javascript 支持 .NET LINQ**  
http://div.io/topic/2197  
LINQ (语言集成查询) 是 .NET Framework 3.5 版中引入的一项创新功能，可以用 Visual Basic 或 C# 为以下数据源编写 LINQ 查询：SQL Server 数据库、XML 文档、ADO.NET 数据集，以及可枚举的 Objects(即 LINQ to Objects)。腾讯文档公式相关工作、早年的 kmdjs 开发 (uglify2) 和 .NET 开发，所以有了 qone 。qone 是一款让 Web 前端工程师在 javascript 使用 .NET 平台下类似 LINQ 语法的前端库。qone 让 Web 前端工程师通过字符串的形式实现了 LINQ to Objects 的调用（下面统一叫做 qone to objects），Objects即 JSON 组成的 Array。

**专访死马：为什么说Egg.js是企业级Node框架**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/36240171  
自从Node.js问世以来，阿里就是国内跟进Node.js最激进的公司之一。阿里不仅在公司内大范围使用Node.js用作服务端开发，2016年还将他们使用Node做Web开发的经验沉淀下来，推出Egg.js开源项目，号称为企业级框架和应用而生。企业级开发对于框架有着诸多要求，那么Egg.js又是怎么满足这些要求的？

**七牛云：工程效率部如何为研发赋能**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4NTU2MTg3MQ==&mid=2655164024&idx=1&sn=756862073ad7498d80e54da0e6d2ce69  
我们的体系主要分三大块：质量管理、工程赋能，以及过程改进。虽然这里有虚线、实线组织，但整体来说是有机的整体。我们不但要做质量，更重要的是在有效率的情况下，如何把质量做到最好。

**阮老师每周分享**  
http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2018/04/weekly-issue-2.html  
这里记录过去一周，我看到的值得分享的东西。长久以来，我一直用各种方式，尝试整理我的收藏夹。最近想到，把它写成文章，共享出来，也许效果更好。感兴趣的可以 RSS 订阅，长期关注。

**Under the hood of CSS and JS animations + how to optimize their performance**  
https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-under-the-hood-of-css-and-js-animations-how-to-optimize-their-performance-db0e79586216  
As you surely know, animations play an essential role in the creation of compelling web apps. As users increasingly shift their attention to UX and businesses start realizing the importance of flawless, enjoyable user journeys, web applications become heavier, and feature more dynamic UI. This all requires more complex animations for smoother state transitions throughout the journey of the user. 

**Replace Animated GIFs with Video**  
https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/replace-animated-gifs-with-video/  
In this article, you're going to learn how to do what the GIF hosting sites do to keep their bandwidth bills from going through the roof, and convert those giant GIFs into lean and fast video files! You'll then learn how to properly embed these videos in web pages so they behave just like GIFs. Finally, we'll talk a little bit about decoding performance for both GIF and video. Before you know it, you'll be well on your way to shaving megabytes off your GIF-heavy web pages in no time at all!

**How to break a Monolith into Microservices**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/break-monolith-into-microservices.html  
As monolithic systems become too large to deal with, many enterprises are drawn to breaking them down into the microservices architectural style. It is a worthwhile journey, but not an easy one. We've learned that to do this well, we need to start with a simple service, but then draw out services that are based on vertical capabilities that are important to the business and subject to frequent change. These services should be large at first and preferably not dependent upon the remaining monolith. We should ensure that each step of migration represents an atomic improvement to the overall architecture. 另附：[Introduction to Microservices](https://blog.algorithmia.com/introduction-to-microservices/)

**MacOS monitoring the open source way**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/04/4696/  
We eventually landed on 3 open source tools: osquery, Santa, and the OpenBSM/Audit system; with each tool serving a specific purpose: osquery provides periodic snapshots describing changes to the state of a machine; Santa provides real-time process launch events containing details about the executing binary; OpenBSM/Audit is real-time system call monitoring module in the macOS kernel that can provide networking, file operations, administrative events, and other system interactions.

**Moving Fast and Securing Things - The SDL at Slack and goSDL**  
https://slack.engineering/moving-fast-and-securing-things-540e6c5ae58a  
For development teams, process can often be antithetical to speed. Ease of deployment and security tend to have an inverse relationship, with some resentment for the security team occasionally mixed in. “SDL” stands for “Security Development Lifecycle”.

**Hijack of Amazon’s internet domain service used to reroute web traffic for two hours unnoticed**  
https://doublepulsar.com/hijack-of-amazons-internet-domain-service-used-to-reroute-web-traffic-for-two-hours-unnoticed-3a6f0dda6a6f  
The attackers used BGP — a key protocol used for routing internet traffic around the world — to reroute traffic to Amazon’s Route 53 service, the largest commercial cloud provider who count major websites such as Twitter.com as customers. 另附：[BGP leaks and cryptocurrencies](https://blog.cloudflare.com/bgp-leaks-and-crypto-currencies/)

**Scaling a High-traffic Rate Limiting Stack With Redis Cluster**  
https://brandur.org/redis-cluster  
Stripe’s rate limiters are built on top of Redis, and until recently, they ran on a single very hot instance of Redis. The server had followers in place for failover, but at any given time, one node was handling every operation. 另附：[Yes, I'm Forking Redis](http://www.dr-josiah.com/2018/04/yes-im-forking-redis-ssltls-transactions.html)。

**Parsing JSON is a Minefield**  
http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php  
I'll show that JSON is not the easy, idealised format as many do believe. Indeed, I did not find two libraries that exhibit the very same behaviour. Moreover, I found that edge cases and maliciously crafted payloads can cause bugs, crashes and denial of services, mainly because JSON libraries rely on specifications that have evolved over time and that left many details loosely specified or not specified at all.

**What Will Programming Look Like In The Future?***  
http://highscalability.com/blog/2018/4/25/update-what-will-programming-look-like-in-the-future.html  
Humans and AIs working together to produce software better than either can separately. The computer as a creative agent, working in tandem with a human partner, to produce software, in a beautiful act of co-creation. What we need is a manufacturing process that puts software production on an exponential curve. The only conceivable tool we have at the moment to put software on an exponential production curve is AI. That's the only way software can truly eat the world.

**Working Together: How Designers And Developers Can Communicate To Create Better Projects**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/04/working-together-designers-developers/  
A good relationship starts with the ability for all of us to take a step back from our strongly held opinions, listen to our colleagues, and learn to compromise. We can then choose tools and workflows which help to support that understanding that we are all on the same team, all trying to do a great job, and all have important viewpoints and experience to bring to the project. 另附：[design systems will only work if we improve the way we work together](http://bradfrost.com/blog/link/design-systems-will-only-work-if-we-improve-the-way-we-work-together/)
