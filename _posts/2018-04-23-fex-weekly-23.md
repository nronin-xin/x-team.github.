**Designing very large (JavaScript) applications**  
https://medium.com/@cramforce/designing-very-large-javascript-applications-6e013a3291a3  
So, let’s talk about very large applications and the things they have in common. Certainly that there might be a lot of developers. It might be a few dozens or even more–and these are humans with feelings and interpersonal problems and you may have to factor that in.

**What You Can Expect From Node.js 10**  
https://nodesource.com/blog/what-you-can-expect-from-node-js-10  
The release of Node.js v10 is just a week away, and will include a suite of new features including updates to errors and the formal addition of N-API. Beyond these new additions, I believe we will continue to see increased adoption and development of Node.js features that have been recently proposed or otherwise landed since the release Node.js 8.

**Yarn vs npm - which Node package manager to use in 2018?**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/yarn-vs-npm-node-js-package-managers/  
Let's take a look at the state of Node.js package managers and what they can do for you! I'll also try to help you to pick one between npm and yarn! 附：[ npm v5.10.0 released](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/173012543745/v5100) & [npm v6.0.0-next.2](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/173148872290/v600-next2)

**It's time to rebuild the web**  
https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/its-time-to-rebuild-the-web  
The web was never supposed to be a few walled gardens of concentrated content owned by a few major publishers; it was supposed to be a cacophony of different sites and voices.

**Enterprise Mobile Backend as a Service - en'zhonWhitepapers**  
https://www.kinvey.com/resources/  
Kinvey named a leader and top ranked current offering in two Forrester Waves. Why not use a top platform to create 5-star apps for your users? 它的技术白皮书挺值得做 BaaS 服务的参考。

**Announcing Docker Enterprise Edition 2.0**  
https://blog.docker.com/2018/04/announcing-docker-enterprise-edition-2-0/  
Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) 2.0 is the only platform that manages and secures applications on Kubernetes in multi-Linux, multi-OS and multi-cloud customer environments. As a complete platform that integrates and scales with your organization, Docker EE 2.0 gives you the most flexibility and choice over the types of applications supported, orchestrators used, and where it’s deployed. 另：[OCI Standardizes Container Registry API Based on Docker’s v2 Protocol](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/04/oci-distribution-spec)

**Gimel: PayPal’s Analytics Data Processing Platform**  
https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2018/04/17/gimel/  
Besides being unable to find the correct datasets, developers, analysts and data scientists don’t want to deal with the code to read and write data, and obviously want to focus their attention and time towards dataset development, analysis and exploration. We built the Gimel Data Platform – the centralized metadata catalog PCatalog and the unified Data API – to address these challenges and help commoditize data access in the big data world.

**Samza Aeon: Latency Insights for Asynchronous One-Way Flows**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/04/samza-aeon--latency-insights-for-asynchronous-one-way-flows  
You can’t fix something if you don’t know there’s a problem. Measuring and tracking the latency of requests through your system is essential to identifying and resolving issues quickly. In order to measure these asynchronous one-way flows, we built a tool called Aeon using Samza, an open source stream processing system developed here at LinkedIn, which we use to gain latency insights across these flows. In this blog post, we’ll describe how we built Aeon and the importance of asynchronous delay monitoring.

**Rethinking GPS: Engineering Next-Gen Location at Uber**

**Distributed architecture concepts I learned while building a large payments system**  
http://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/distributed-architecture-concepts-i-have-learned-while-building-payments-systems/   
In this post, I am summarizing some of the concepts that I have found essential to learn and apply when building a large scale, highly available and distributed system: the payments system that powers Uber. This is a system with a load of up to thousands of requests per second, where critical payments functionality needs to work correctly, even if parts of the system are down. 另附：[Google: A Collection Of Best Practices For Production Services](http://highscalability.com/blog/2018/4/16/google-a-collection-of-best-practices-for-production-service.html)

**Probability Theory (For Scientists and Engineers**  
https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/probability_theory.html  
Formal probability theory is a rich and complex field of mathematics with a reputation for being confusing if not outright impenetrable. Much of that intimidation, however, is due not to the abstract mathematics but rather how they are employed in practice. In particular, many introductions to probability theory sloppily confound the abstract mathematics with their practical implementations, convoluting what we can calculate in the theory with how we perform those calculations.

**Apple open-sources FoundationDB**  
https://www.foundationdb.org/blog/foundationdb-is-open-source/  
FoundationDB is a distributed datastore, designed from the ground up to be deployed on clusters of commodity hardware. These clusters scale well as you add machines, automatically heal from hardware failures, and have a simple API. The key-value store supports fully global, cross-row ACID transactions. That's the highest level of data consistency possible. What does this mean for you? Strong consistency makes your application code simpler, your data models more efficient, and your failure modes less surprising. 另：[MySQL 8.0 Released](https://mysqlserverteam.com/whats-new-in-mysql-8-0-generally-available/)

**Introducing GitHub Learning Lab: A new way to level up on GitHub**  
https://blog.github.com/2018-04-19-introducing-github-learning-lab/  
GitHub is more than a home for code. It’s a forum for collaboration, a sandbox for testing, a launchpad for deployment, and often, a platform for learning new skills. After training thousands of people to use Git and GitHub, the GitHub Training Team has established a tried-and-true method for helping new developers retain more information and ramp up quickly as they begin their software journeys. And now, we’re making those experiences accessible to developers everywhere with GitHub Learning Lab. 另附：[Using Figma designs to build the Octicons icon library](https://blog.github.com/2018-04-12-driving-changes-from-designs/)

https://lemire.me/blog/2018/04/17/introducing-gapmindervr-data-visualization-in-virtual-reality/  
I am a big fan of sites such as Gapminder and Our World in Data. Such data visualization sites are like intellectual pornography. You want to know which countries are doing better? Which continents drink more alcohol? How is alcohol related to GDP? Have people getting fatter recently, or is that a long trend? You don’t need to read thick books, you can just browse graphs.

**How AI Wipes Out UI**  
https://uxplanet.org/how-ai-wipes-out-ui-10ecaad1356a  
Only after we master the ability to materialize things from the air, utilize quantum computers to generate data, and operate machines with our minds, can we think of the real synergy with AI. Before that, our little robots will be our assistants and will do only what they’re supposed to do. 另附：[Good Designer, Bad Designer](https://uxplanet.org/good-designer-bad-designer-eff79d356a75)

**The long, incredibly tortuous, and fascinating process of creating a Chinese font**  
https://qz.com/522079/the-long-incredibly-tortuous-and-fascinating-process-of-creating-a-chinese-font/  
The default set for English-language fonts contains about 230 glyphs. A font that covers all of the Latin scripts—that’s over 100 languages plus extra symbols—contains 840 glyphs, according to Březina. The simplified version of Chinese, used primarily in mainland China, requires nearly 7,000 glyphs. For traditional Chinese, used in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the number of glyphs is 13,053. An experienced designer, working alone, can in under six months create a new font that covers dozens of Western languages. For a single Chinese font it takes a team of several designers at least two years.

**Jupyter, Mathematica, and the Future of the Research Paper**  
https://paulromer.net/jupyter-mathematica-and-the-future-of-the-research-paper/  
The Atlantic has a great article on new ways to share research results. Its three parts make three points: A graphical user interface (GUI) can facilitate better technical writing; Wolfram’s proprietary notebook showcased innovative technology, but decades after its introduction, still has few users; Jupyter is a new open-source alternative that is well on the way to becoming a standard for exchanging research results. Each is spot on. I had to learn the hard way why so many kept their distance from Mathematica. Now, I’m much more productive with Jupyter. I’m experimenting with, and excited about, its potential as a way to write up research results. 另附：[Interactive Go programming with Jupyter](https://medium.com/@yunabe/interactive-go-programming-with-jupyter-93fbf089aff1)

**蚂蚁金服CTO程立：碎片化的文章永远无法让人建立起一个对有深度的问题的真正的、系统的理解**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/prmMT4RQ3VNcINA8uOWwqA  
过去一年，碎片化信息阅读越来越多了，但相比铺天盖地的头条、公众号文章，我更喜欢读书。碎片化的文章永远无法让人建立起一个对有深度的问题的真正的、系统的理解，比如 AI、比如区块链、比如黎曼假设。黎曼假设据说是数学中最深刻的未解问题，它说的是“Zeta 函数的所有非平凡零点的实部都是 1/2”，仅仅想搞清楚这句话到底是什么意思，它为什么那么重要，就足以激发无限的好奇心了。

**工作中如何做好技术积累**  
https://tech.meituan.com/study_vs_work.html  
如何在繁忙的工作中做好技术积累，构建个人核心竞争力，相信是很多工程师同行都在思考的问题。本文是我自己的一些总结，试图从三个方面来解答：第一部分阐述了一些学习的原则。任何时候，遵循一些经过检验的原则，都是影响效率的重要因素，正确的方法是成功的秘诀；提升工作和学习效率的另一个重要因素是释惑和良好心态。第二部分分析了我在工作中碰到和看到的一些典型困惑；成为优秀的架构师是大部分初中级工程师的阶段性目标。第三部分剖析架构师的能力模型，让大家对目标所需能力有一个比较清晰的认知。
