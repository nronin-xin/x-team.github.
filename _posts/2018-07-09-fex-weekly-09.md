**Web Components in 2018**  
https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2018/07/06/web-components-in-2018/  
Adoption and hype around Web Components have been extended and undulating. That said, as the Web Component specifications gain better adoption, the need for polyfills should gradually dissolve, keeping them leaner and faster for users. The Shadow DOM allows developers to write simple, scoped CSS which is arguably easier to manage and generally better for performance. Custom Elements give a unified methodology for defining components that can (in theory) get used across codebases and teams.

**Vue.js: the good, the meh, and the ugly**  
https://medium.com/@Pier/vue-js-the-good-the-meh-and-the-ugly-82800bbe6684  
Moving from React to Vue, two years later. Picking up new frameworks and libraries is exciting but also stressful. Even after some evaluation you never really know what skeletons you’re going to find out down the road. My honeymoon period is long over. After about 2 years of using Vue almost daily I can finally write about it with some perspective. 另附：[Building Mobile Apps With Capacitor And Vue.js](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/mobile-apps-capacitor-vue-js/).

**What Is Redux: A Designer’s Guide**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/redux-designers-guide/  
Do you know Redux’s real power is beyond managing the state? Do you want to design with an understanding of how Redux works in mind? Let’s dig deeper into what Redux can do, why it does its things, what the downsides are, and how it relates to design.

**React Native: A retrospective from the mobile-engineering team at Udacity**  
https://engineering.udacity.com/react-native-a-retrospective-from-the-mobile-engineering-team-at-udacity-89975d6a8102  
The mobile team here at Udacity recently removed the last features in our apps that were written with React Native. We’ve received numerous questions regarding our usage or React Native and why we’ve stopped investing in it. In this post, I hope to answer the majority of the questions we’ve received and give insight into: What is the size & makeup of our particular team? Why did we try React Native in the first place? What was the reason for removing it? What worked? What didn’t? 另附：[Would Airbnb Have Fared Better With NativeScript Instead of React Native](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/would-airbnb-have-fared-better-with-nativescript-instead-of-react-native)、[Releasing 0.56 · React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/07/04/releasing-react-native-056).

**前端遇上Go: 静态资源增量更新的新实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/fe-and-golang.html  
美团金融的业务在过去的一段时间里发展非常快速。在业务增长的同时，我们也注意到，很多用户的支付环境，其实是在弱网环境中的。大家知道，前端能够服务用户的前提是 JavaScript 和 CSS 等静态资源能够正确加载。如果网络环境恶劣，那么我们的静态资源尺寸越大，用户下载失败的概率就越高。根据我们的数据统计，我们的业务中有2%的用户流失与资源加载有关。因此每次更新的代价越小、加载成功率越高，用户流失率也就会越低，从而就能够变相提高订单的转化率。

**实施前端微服务化的六七种方式**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5Mjg4NDMwMA==&mid=2652975949&idx=1&sn=c36387188283dd4fae52257357541729  
[微前端架构](https://microfrontend.cn/)是一种类似于微服务的架构，它将微服务的理念应用于浏览器端，即将 Web 应用由单一的单体应用转变为多个小型前端应用聚合为一的应用。由此带来的变化是，这些前端应 用可以独立运行、独立开发、独立部署。以及，它们应该可以在共享组件的同时进行并行开发——这些组件可以通过 NPM 或者 Git Tag、Git Submodule 来管理。

**科普文：服务器上如何 Node 多版本共存**  
https://yuque.com/egg/nodejs/node-multi-versioning  
很多公司的服务器环境没有做隔离，就是全局安装一个 Node.js Runtime，一般很少升级。nvs / nvm 等可以用来切换版本，但无法同时共存。而且一般服务器不允许你随意升级。因此很多同学都会很痛苦：「都 8012 年了，还是 Node 4.x 甚至 0.x 简直想死！」时至今天，最好的办法就是 Docker。但奈何很多小公司还处于水深火热之中。本文将介绍下我们很早前就使用的一套方案，可以完美解决非 Docker 情况下 Node 多版本共存问题。[科普文：为什么不能在服务器上 npm install](https://yuque.com/egg/nodejs/should-not-npm-install-online)

**Get Better Type Checking in JavaScript with the Maybe Type**  
https://blog.bitsrc.io/get-better-type-checking-in-javascript-with-the-maybe-type-e7f70b23b505  
Maybe type is a popular abstraction for defining values that may or may not exist. It encapsulates the type checking and guards our code against any error or bugs caused by the missing values. In this post, I will show how to use Maybe and keep your app readable and maintainable. Let’s dive in.

**Pointer events with React — The why, how, what?**  
https://medium.com/@wesharehoodies/pointer-events-with-react-the-why-how-what-617a5b51dbb2  
Back in the good old days we only had a mouse and listening for events was simple. The web content assumed the user’s pointing device will be a mouse. Nowadays we have many devices which don’t correlate to having a mouse, like phones with touch surface or pens. How can we listen for events if the user doesn’t have a mouse?

**Resilient, Declarative, Contextual**  
https://keithjgrant.com/posts/2018/06/resilient-declarative-contextual/  
Today I want to take a different tack. I want to look at three key characteristics of CSS that set it apart from conventional programming languages: it’s resilient; it’s declarative; and it’s contextual. Understanding these aspects of the language, I think, is key to becoming proficient in CSS.

**Clearfix: A Lesson in Web Development Evolution**  
https://css-tricks.com/clearfix-a-lesson-in-web-development-evolution/  
The web community has, for the most part, been a spectacularly open place. As such, a lot of the best development techniques happen right out in the open, on blogs and in forums, evolving as they’re passed around and improved. I thought it might be fun (and fascinating) to actually follow this creative exchange all the way through. To take a look at a popular CSS trick, the clearfix, and find out exactly how a web design technique comes to be.

**Building a Snipping Tool with Electron, React and Node.js**  
https://quantizd.com/building-a-snipping-tool-with-electron-react-and-node-js/  
In this tutorial, I’ll show how to build a snipping tool using  desktopCapturer module. We’ll use React for building our application’s user interface and Nodejs as a backend server for uploading snipped images.

**A Real-World WebAssembly Benchmark**  
https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/a-real-world-webassembly-benchmark/  
Rendering PDF documents is a complex task: The format is 25 years old and has many edge cases. It wouldn’t be feasible for us to rewrite the equivalent of 500,000 lines of C++ code to JavaScript, but technologies such as WebAssembly and asm.js allow us to use the same codebase in a browser, delivering a consistent level of high-fidelity rendering and parsing of PDF documents everywhere. Performance of the WebAssembly code has been a focus for us since day one, and it’s amazing to see the entire industry move toward a shared goal: making WebAssembly fast. This starts with optimizing WebAssembly startup time, compiler improvements, and continuous browser upgrades.

**How to drop 10 million packets per second**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-drop-10-million-packets/  
Internally our DDoS mitigation team is sometimes called "the packet droppers". When other teams build exciting products to do smart things with the traffic that passes through our network, we take joy in discovering novel ways of discarding it. Being able to quickly discard packets is very important to withstand DDoS attacks. Dropping packets hitting our servers, as simple as it sounds, can be done on multiple layers. Each technique has its advantages and limitations. In this blog post we'll review all the techniques we tried thus far.

**A one size fits all database doesn't fit anyone**  
https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2018/06/purpose-built-databases-in-aws.html  
A common question that I get is why do we offer so many database products? The answer for me is simple: Developers want their applications to be well architected and scale effectively. To do this, they need to be able to use multiple databases and data models within the same application.

**The Not-So-Dark Art Of Designing Database Indexes: Reflections From An Average Software Engineer**  
https://www.bennadel.com/blog/3467-the-not-so-dark-art-of-designing-database-indexes-reflections-from-an-average-software-engineer.htm  
What I eventually came to realize, after years of impostor syndrome, was that database index design is simply not that mysterious: If you need to access data quickly, you index it. If the performance of data access isn't a concern, you don't index it. That's 90-percent of what you need to know about database indexing

**Rules of optimization**  
http://www.humus.name/index.php?page=News&ID=383  
Basically Programming Wisdom (which btw often is a great sources for actual programming wisdom) posted a quote that basically suggested more or less that there’s never a good time to think about performance. Even experts should defer it until later! This is way worse advice than your usual “premature optimization is the root of all evil” tirade. The premature optimization at least addresses something that can be a bit of a problem, i.e. that programmers go ahead and obfuscate code in order to make it faster, without even looking at whether the code had any performance problem to begin with or verifying that the new code actually is any faster, and in the process of doing this introducing bugs and reducing readability.

**Timsort — the fastest sorting algorithm you’ve never heard of**

With the release of 1.11, let’s take a look at the core Kubernetes work that Google is driving, as well as some of the innovation we've built on Kubernetes’ foundations in the last three months.

**Democratizing APIs with Natural Language Interfaces**  
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/democratizing-apis-with-natural-language-interfaces/  
We have been studying natural language interfaces to APIs (NL2APIs). Different from general-purpose NLIs like virtual assistants, we examined how to build NLIs for individual web APIs, for example, the API to a calendar service. Such NL2APIs have the potential to democratize APIs by helping users communicate with software systems. They can also address the scalability issue of general-purpose virtual assistants by allowing for distributed development.

**Order Out of Chaos: Patterns of Organization for Writing on the Job**  
http://alistapart.com/article/order-out-of-chaos-patterns-of-organization-for-writing-on-the-job  
Given the endless variety of writing situations, there is no such thing as a single organization solution. But saying that “advice varies widely depending on the situation” doesn’t tell the whole story. There are flexible patterns and principles that can guide you in finding, customizing, and creating structures for your goals. The key thing to remember is that structure affects meaning. The sequence of information, the categories you use, the emphasis you imply through your hierarchy—all of these decisions impact how well your audience understands what you write. Your ideal structure should therefore reinforce what you mean to say.

**Design Principles That Help You Shape The Best User Experience**  
https://blog.marvelapp.com/design-principles-help-shape-best-user-experience/  
Every product has an ultimate goal — to help people solve certain problems. When designing a product, you need to keep user experience in mind, you don’t want to create a product that is more complicated than the actual problem the users have. There are some principles to follow when designing a product. It could be an app, a website or a physical product. These principles would help you shape better user experience.

**Better Research, Better Design, Better Results**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/better-research-design-results/  
Most web professionals like to see their influence felt in web design projects as early as possible, in order to make sure what they have to say gets heard. Yet often SEOs and content marketers are asked to step in post-launch when the design work is more or less complete. However, there are very real benefits, ranging from better UX to lower costs to using SEO-focused data such as keyword research as a springboard for design and development, rather than having to turn to it further down the line.

**Mobile App Design Best Practices and Mistakes**  
https://www.toptal.com/designers/mobile/mobile-app-design-mistakes  
The most common mistakes span from failing to maintain consistency throughout the lifespan of an app to difficulty attracting users in the first place. It’s challenging to design an app with intuitive simplicity without it becoming repetitive and boring. An app has to offer pleasing design and UX details without losing sight of a greater purpose. Most apps live and die in the first few days, so following some basic mobile app design best practices and avoiding the most common mistakes will help designers create apps that live past that 90-day mark.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJZbv4J6FZ8Dnb0JuMhJxTnwl-dwqx5xl0s65DE3wO8/edit#  
I coach tech startup CEOs (and tech investors) in Silicon Valley,  most of whom are young technical founders. They include the CEOs of Coinbase, ClearBit, AngelList, CoinList, TrustToken, Bolt, Shogun, Speechify, etc.  In my coaching, I found several things: Becoming a great CEO requires training;  For a founding CEO, there is precious little time to get that training, especially if her company is succeeding; While there are many books out there with excellent and relevant knowledge for the founding CEO, there is no single book that is a compendium of all the things she needs to learn; My mentees and I repeatedly solve the same core issues together. In this book, I have simply written down the solutions that we came up with. And hopefully it will serve as a compendium so that you can become a great CEO in the very little time you have to do so.
