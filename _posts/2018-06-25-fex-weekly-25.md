his post provides a preview of some of the highlights in anticipation of the release. In parallel we have reduced the memory consumption of SFIs themselves, removing unnecessary fields or compressing them where possible, and decreased their size by ~25%, with further reductions coming in future releases. In V8 v6.8 you can start using trap-based bounds checking on Linux x64 platforms. Performance improvements: Array destructuring, Object.assign, TypedArray.prototype.sort. 

**The Cost Of JavaScript - Addy Osmani**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63I-mEuSvGA  
Addy Osmani explains how and why JavaScript is the most expensive resource your site uses today—especially on mobile. Addy also shares tips for fixing JavaScript performance issues so everything loads quicker. A little discipline can help if you want your site to load and be interactive as soon as possible on mobile. As a result, moving forward, we are sunsetting React Native at Airbnb and reinvesting all of our efforts back into native, 见 [Sunsetting React Native](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a). 另附：[State of React Native 2018](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018)

**Github Stars !== Usage: React is still blowing Vue and Angular Away**  
https://zendev.com/2018/06/19/react-usage-beating-vue-angular.html  
By digging into the NPM download statistics, we find that despite the hype around Vue's skyrocketing github stars, React is still the 800 pound gorilla in the JavaScript framework space. It is about to cross the mammoth 10 million downloads per month, and has been growing at a torrid rate.

**Using JavaScript modules on the web**

**前端开发-领域驱动设计**  
https://yuque.com/mayiprototeam/gfyt69/oq14ia  
随着我们解决的场景越来越专业化和复杂化，大型SPA应用的流行，前端承担的职责越来越多。代码的质量和系统的完整性越来越难把握。很容易导致迭代着迭代着发现代码改不动了。最后只能新起炉灶，重新开发。归根到底在于复杂度的失控，本文会尝试分析其中的问题以及从前端如何应用领域模型开发的角度给出一些建议。

**WWDC2018 - 来自一线开发者的技术笔记**

感谢头条的同学的分享。

**React Native at Airbnb**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/react-native-at-airbnb-f95aa460be1c  
In 2016, we took a big bet on React Native. Different teams had a wide range of experiences with React Native. React Native proved to be an incredible tool at times while posing technical and organizational challenges in others. In this series, we provide a detailed account of our experiences with it and what we’re doing next.

**How JavaScript works: the internals of Shadow DOM + how to build self-contained components**  
https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-the-internals-of-shadow-dom-how-to-build-self-contained-components-244331c4de6e  
Web Components is a suite of different technologies that allows you to create reusable custom elements.Their functionality is encapsulated away from the rest of your code, and you can utilize them in your web apps. There are 4 Web Component standards: Shadow DOM, HTML Templates, Custom elements, HTML Imports. In this article, we’ll focus on the Shadow DOM.

**End-to-end testing Single Page Apps and Node.js APIs with Cucumber.js and Puppeteer**  
https://medium.com/@anephenix/end-to-end-testing-single-page-apps-and-node-js-apis-with-cucumber-js-and-puppeteer-ad5a519ace0  
Single Page Apps are a popular approach to building web applications, but testing them in an end-to-end fashion is not simple; you need to load the backend (potentially a collection of APIs and databases), and make sure that the combination of the SPA and APIs works as expected. The good news is that there is a way to do this, and in this article we will show you how, using a Behaviour-Driven-Development tool called Cucumber.js, and Google’s web browser library Puppeteer. If you develop Node.js web applications and want to use E2E testing for them but don’t know how, then this article is for you.

**MySQL High Availability at GitHub**  
https://githubengineering.com/mysql-high-availability-at-github/  
GitHub uses MySQL as its main datastore for all things non-git, and its availability is critical to GitHub’s operation. The site itself, GitHub’s API, authentication and more, all require database access. This post illustrates GitHub’s MySQL high availability and master service discovery solution, which allows us to reliably run a cross-data-center operation, be tolerant of data center isolation, and achieve short outage times on a failure. 另附：[Databases in 2018: The State of the Developer Ecosystem](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/devecosystem-2018/databases/)

**Post Inspector: A Tool to Optimize Content Sharing**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/06/post-inspector-\-a-tool-to-optimize-content-sharing  
The Content Ingestion team at LinkedIn primarily focuses on discovering content across the web and ingesting it into the LinkedIn content ecosystem. Not only do we ingest content whenever a member shares a URL, but we also proactively search for interesting content that our members could enjoy. Given the team’s focus, we’ve created a tool—called Post Inspector—for external content providers and internal teams at LinkedIn that provides insight into how we extract metadata so that content providers can easily optimize the sharing experience of their content on the LinkedIn platform.  

**Growth Engineering at Netflix — Accelerating Innovation**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/growth-engineering-at-netflix-accelerating-innovation-90eb8e70ce59  
The customer experience is remarkably different in each of these cases, but the goal is the same. We seek to offer the best possible signup experience to our prospective members while at the same time, remaining extremely lean, agile and efficient in our implementation of these disparate experiences. Offering an amazing signup experience for thousands of devices in over 190 countries is an incredibly challenging and rewarding task.

**Fibonacci Hashing: The Optimization that the World Forgot**  
https://probablydance.com/2018/06/16/fibonacci-hashing-the-optimization-that-the-world-forgot-or-a-better-alternative-to-integer-modulo/  
Hash tables should not be prime number sized and they should not use an integer modulo to map hashes into slots. Fibonacci hashing is just better. Yet somehow nobody is using it and lots of big hash tables (including all the big implementations of std::unordered_map) are much slower than they should be because they don’t use Fibonacci Hashing. So let’s figure this out. 另附：[How Ably Efficiently Implemented Consistent Hashing](http://highscalability.com/blog/2018/6/18/how-ably-efficiently-implemented-consistent-hashing.html)

**ActorDB - A distributed SQL database**  
https://github.com/biokoda/actordb  
With the scalability of a KV store, while keeping the query capabilities of a relational database. ActorDB is ideal as a server side database for apps. Think of running a large mail service, dropbox, evernote, etc. They all require server side storage for user data, but the vast majority of queries is within a specific user. With many users, the server side database can get very large. Using ActorDB you can keep a full relational database for every user and not be forced into painful scaling strategies that require you to throw away everything that makes relational databases good.

**Don’t Use The Placeholder Attribute**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/placeholder-attribute/  
The placeholder attribute contains a surprising amount of issues that prevent it from delivering on what it promises. Let’s clarify why you need to stop using it.

**Introducing Inspect: Where the file is the design spec**

**How to scale product design with DesignOps**  
https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/scale-product-design-designops/  
The role of design operations, also known as DesignOps, is becoming more and more important as the fields of design and technology become increasingly integrated. It primarily refers to the practice of developing a more efficient design workflow process in organizations. DesignOps can be defined as a collaboration between design, technology, and engineering teams that streamlines and advances the design workflow process in an organization. 另附：[How we use Freehand at InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/use-freehand-invision/)、[DesignOps: the questions you’re probably asking yourself now](https://uxdesign.cc/designops-the-questions-youre-probably-asking-yourself-now-fdac491bfe4f)

**Interface Exploration: Depth and Color**  
https://blog.marvelapp.com/interface-exploration-depth-color/  
Over the last decade, interface design has seen a turn from replication of the physical/material (referred to as skeuomorphism) to a much more flat, abstract aesthetic. While this new visual style appears more appealing, I’ve felt that a sense of intuition and approachability has been lost by discarding some skeuomorphic characteristics. In order to further explore these observations, I endeavored to visualize a future interface that finds a balance between minimalism and physical context, for a future that will further enable people to interact with seamless slabs of glass and simulate tactile buttons.

**Using design to make hard life choices**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/using-design-to-make-hard-life-choices-e660ebedfe3c  
When we ask for advice on these tough problems, our friends and family sometimes tell us things like “you’ll just know when things are right” or “find what works for you!” Of course, these just make us feel worse. Eventually we may convince ourselves this is just how things are supposed to be. Life is hard, problems are hard, and others have success because they had the right “blocks” close at hand (which certainly helps, but is rarer than we like to think). Being a little sad about life is normal, right? I think it’s wrong. The biggest parts of your life are not supposed to make you feel bad.

移动互联网的格局战争基本结束，正在变成基础产业，新产业将会崛起。后来，我慢慢意识到——跨界融合、新技术、新应用是未来时代最大的机会。今天有一个非常流行的词汇叫“VUCA时代”，表示当今时代显现出“从复杂到超级复杂”的特征。其实VUCA是四个英语单词的对应：易变性、不确定性、复杂性、模糊性。这四个特性，也是这个时代非常鲜明的写照。这个时代，其实已经不是单一面，而是从复杂到超级复杂的时代。人们越来越焦虑，学习心态变得越来越重要。

任何企业最后一定会遭遇成熟期，会陷入到非连续性的窘境，会遭遇到阿喀琉斯之踵。这时，原本帮助企业进步、成长的企业文化，反而成为最限制成长的枷锁。我们把它叫做“企业心智枷锁”。大公司转型非常困难，有没有成功的经验？刷新微软。但是这个案例太难了，要费非常大的力气才能做到。正因为它难，一旦形成之后，非常神奇，而且它的改革者本人是内部的职业经理人。
