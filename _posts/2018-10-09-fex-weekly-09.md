**Solid – Reshape the web as we know it**  
https://solid.inrupt.com/
Solid was created by the inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Its mission is to reshape the web as we know it. Solid will foster a new breed of applications with capabilities above and beyond anything that exists today. Solid empowers users and organizations to separate their data from the applications that use it. It allows people to look at the same data with different apps at the same time. It opens brand new avenues for creativity, problem-solving, and commerce. Learn how it came to be. 另附：[Tim Berners-Lee tells us his radical new plan to upend the World Wide Web](https://www.fastcompany.com/90243936/exclusive-tim-berners-lee-tells-us-his-radical-new-plan-to-upend-the-world-wide-web)、[How solid is Tim’s plan to redecentralize the web?](https://medium.com/@shevski/how-solid-is-tims-plan-to-redecentralize-the-web-b163ba78e835)

**Mastering Modular JavaScript**  
https://github.com/mjavascript/mastering-modular-javascript
Modular JavaScript is a book series with the mission of improving our collective understanding of writing robust, well-tested, modular JavaScript code. Mastering Modular JavaScript is the second book in the series, and it discusses modular JavaScript application development. Mastering Modular JavaScript includes hundreds of real-world patterns and practices, as well as detailed explanations of what works and what hasn’t when it comes to leveraging ES6 in the wild. 另附：[What is Modular CSS?](https://spaceninja.com/2018/09/17/what-is-modular-css/)

**How to Build a Low-tech Website?**  
https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/
Low-tech Magazine was born in 2007 and has seen minimal changes ever since. Because a website redesign was long overdue — and because we try to practice what we preach — we decided to build a low-tech, self-hosted, and solar-powered version of Low-tech Magazine. The new blog is designed to radically reduce the energy use associated with accessing our content. 

**Plans for the Next Iteration of Vue.js**  
https://medium.com/the-vue-point/plans-for-the-next-iteration-of-vue-js-777ffea6fabf
Vue 3.0 aims to leverage these new language features to make Vue core smaller, faster, and more powerful. Vue 3.0 is currently in prototyping phase, and we have already implemented a runtime close to feature-parity with 2.x. Many of the items listed below are either already implemented, or confirmed to be feasible.

**When a bar chart isn’t enough… Morph helps you turn data into art**  
https://medium.com/google-news-lab/when-a-bar-chart-isnt-enough-morph-helps-you-turn-data-into-art-986e41a33837
Sometimes a bar chart just won’t do. Sometimes you want to see data presented in a new way, a way it just hasn’t been shown as before. That’s where [Morph](https://morph.graphics/) comes in. Morph is a brand new tool, built by data studio Datavized, to allow anyone to create their own computer-generated data art project.

**The Shapes of CSS**  
https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/
We also get the ::before and ::after psuedo elements in CSS, which give us the potential of two more shapes we can add to the original element. By getting clever with positioning, transforming, and many other tricks, we can make lots of shapes in CSS with only a single HTML element.

**On Node Framework Popularity**  
https://hueniverse.com/on-node-framework-popularity-355fbde5cbe4
Much of the conversation about choosing an HTTP framework for your node.js application is about performance, features, stability, and support. But when almost every framework available delivers enterprise-grade performance, cutting edge features, and are generally well maintained, do the technical specs really matter that much? 另附：[awesome-nodejs](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs).

**Validating performance and reliability of the new Dropbox search engine**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/10/validating-performance-and-reliability-of-the-new-dropbox-search-engine/
In our previous post, we discussed the architecture of our new search engine, named Nautilus, and its use of machine intelligence to scale our search–ranking and content–understanding models. Along with best–in–class performance, scalability, and reliability, we also provided a foundation for implementing intelligent document ranking and retrieval features. This flexible system allows our engineers to easily customize the document–indexing and query–processing pipelines while maintaining strong safeguards to preserve the privacy of our users’ data. In this post, we will discuss the process that we undertook to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

**Open-sourcing StateService: Automating recovery of third-party services after a major outage**  
https://code.fb.com/open-source/stateservice/
[StateService](https://github.com/facebookincubator/StateService) is self-documenting — the individual states become part of configuration management (CM) software, such as a Chef cookbook. By replaying the states that were previously applied to a VM (or a group of VMs), StateService returns services to their last-known state.

**Upgrading GitHub from Rails 3.2 to 5.2**  
https://githubengineering.com/upgrading-github-from-rails-3-2-to-5-2/
On August 15th GitHub celebrated a major milestone: our main application is now running on the latest version of Rails: 5.2.1! In total the project took a year and a half to upgrade from Rails 3.2 to Rails 5.2. Along the way we took time to clean up technical debt and improve the overall codebase while doing the upgrade. Below we’ll talk about how we upgraded Rails, lessons we learned and whether we’d do it again.

**Node + JS Foundation**  
https://www.linuxfoundation.org/news/2018/10/node-js-foundation-and-js-foundation-announce-intent-to-create-joint-organization-to-support-the-broad-node-js-and-javascript-communities/
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/178734613655/node-js-foundation
Today, JavaScript is nearly ubiquitous. Enterprises have been able to greatly reduce training costs and increase developer productivity because frontend JS developers can work on the server side, and vice-versa, eliminating the context switches and enabling all developers to pull from the same knowledge base and vast module ecosystem. Node.js is a major catalyst for this growth. It has become an important part of the modern web development stack and is often the assumed default when working with JavaScript. Merging the Foundations will bring the governance of these technologies in line with its real-world use.

**Motion design doesn’t have to be hard**  
https://medium.com/google-design/motion-design-doesnt-have-to-be-hard-33089196e6c2
Motion helps make UIs expressive and easy to use. Despite having so much potential, motion is perhaps the least understood of all the design disciplines. This may be due to it being one of the newer members of the UI design family. Visual and interaction design dates back to early GUIs, but motion had to wait for modern hardware to render animation smoothly. 

**The Psychology of Design**  
https://alistapart.com/article/psychology-of-design
There are a number of debates about which additional skills designers should learn. Should designers code, write, or understand business? These skills are incredibly valuable but perhaps not essential. However, I would argue that every designer should learn the fundamentals of psychology. But knowing where to start can be a challenge. Which principles from psychology are useful? What are some examples of these principles at work? In this article, I’ll cover the basics, and discuss the ethical implications of using psychology in design.

**Product Design by Google**
