**Concurrent marking in V8**  
https://v8project.blogspot.com/2018/06/concurrent-marking.html  
This post describes the garbage collection technique called concurrent marking. The optimization allows a JavaScript application to continue execution while the garbage collector scans the heap to find and mark live objects. Our benchmarks show that concurrent marking reduces the time spent marking on the main thread by 60%–70%. Concurrent marking is the last puzzle piece of the Orinoco project — the project to incrementally replace the old garbage collector with the new mostly concurrent and parallel garbage collector. Concurrent marking is enabled by default in Chrome 64 and Node.js v10.

**State of React Native 2018**  
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018  
Alongside the community inside Facebook, we're happy to have a thriving population of React Native users and collaborators outside Facebook. We'd like to support the React Native community more, both by serving React Native users better and by making the project easier to contribute to. Just as our architecture changes will help React Native interoperate more cleanly with other native infrastructure, React Native should be slimmer on the JavaScript side to fit better with the JavaScript ecosystem, which includes making the VM and bundler swappable.

**Introducing the GraphQL Guide**  
https://blog.graphql.guide/introducing-the-graphql-guide-11a5ae48628a  
jQuery 作者新书。The Guide shows you why GraphQL APIs are the true successor to REST APIs. We’ll be looking at the core fundamentals of GraphQL along with strategies for how to implement it (client-side with Apollo and server-side in Node.js). Additionally, we’ll be exploring different situations in which GraphQL can be used (on mobile with React Native or Java/Swift, and on the web with either React or Vue).

**From Node.js to Go: There, and back again**  
https://www.thenativeweb.io/blog/2018-06-12-15-47-from-node-to-go-there-and-back-again/  
A few years ago, we chose Go over Node.js for writing the wolkenkit CLI. A few months ago we rewrote everything from scratch, this time using Node.js again. We've learned that you can't dance at two weddings.

**Building A Pub/Sub Service In-House Using Node.js And Redis**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/pub-sub-service-in-house-node-js-redis/  
As the size of data for each message in our system differs from a few bytes to up to 100MB, we needed a scalable solution that could support a multitude of scenarios. In this article, Dhimil Gosalia explains why you should consider building an in-house Pub/Sub service, too.

**Eggjs 和 SOFA 的跨语言互调**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/38004479

**结合源码分析 Node.js 模块加载与运行原理**  
http://efe.baidu.com/blog/nodejs-module-analyze/  
在 Node.js 中使用模块非常简单，我们日常开发中几乎都有过这样的经历：写一段 JavaScript 代码，require 一些想要的包，然后将代码产物 exports 导出。但是，对于 Node.js 模块化背后的加载与运行原理，我们是否清楚呢。首先抛出以下几个问题：Node.js 中的模块支持哪些文件类型？核心模块和第三方模块的加载运行流程有什么不同？除了 JavaScript 模块以外，怎样去写一个 C/C++ 扩展模块？本篇文章，就会结合 Node.js 源码，探究一下以上这些问题背后的答案。

**是时候好好安利下LuLu UI框架了**  
https://l-ui.com/  
LuLu UI是阅文前端荣誉出品的UI框架，基于jQuery，针对PC网站，兼容IE8+，包含20+静态或动态UI组件，非常适合面向外部用户的网站开发。其实 jQuery 如果有一个像 AntD 这么漂亮的 UI 库的话，应该还是有不少人会用的。

**如何提高代码的可读性**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/34982747  
编程语言的文本形式决定了它只能提高一个方面的信噪比而放弃其他方面的信噪比。但是文本不是唯一的信息获取方式。IDE 或者 PaaS 完全可以用各种不同的方式重组信息。

**The new (and old) CSS units you've never heard about**  
https://dev.to/maxart2501/the-new-and-old-css-units-youve-never-heard-about-1mn1  
Talking about CSS that you might - but more probably might not! - have heard, and even less used, about the units described in this article. And no, not like the "old" vw and vh (which I happen to still have to explain to those less proficient in CSS).

**Image Inconsistencies: How and When Browsers Download Images**  
https://csswizardry.com/2018/06/image-inconsistencies-how-and-when-browsers-download-images/  
Firefox and Safari seem to have the most preferred behaviour here: they won’t download background-images that they know they won’t need. Chrome, Opera, and Edge will all download background-images that are applied to invisible elements.

**The Trouble with D3**  
https://medium.com/dailyjs/the-trouble-with-d3-4a84f7de011f  
Recently there were a couple of threads on Twitter discussing the difficulties associated with learning d3.js. I’ve also seen this come up in many similar conversations I’ve had at meetups, conferences, workshops, mailing list threads and slack chats. While I agree that many of the difficulties are real, the threads highlight a common misconception that needs to be cleared up if we want to help people getting into data visualization.

**Your Brain on Front-End Development**  
https://css-tricks.com/your-brain-on-front-end-development/  
Part of the job of being a front-end developer is applying different techniques and technologies to pull off the desired UI and UX. Perhaps you work with a design team and implement their designs. I know when I look at a design (heck, even if I know I'm not going to be building it), my front-end brain starts triggering all sorts of things I know will be related to the task. Let's take a look at what I mean.

**Reverse Engineering Instruments’ File Format**  
http://jamie-wong.com/post/reverse-engineering-instruments-file-format/  
At Figma, I work in a C++ codebase that cross-compiles to asm.js and WebAssembly to run in the browser. Occasionally, however, it’s helpful to be able to profile the native build we use for development and debugging. The tool of choice to do that on OS X is Instruments. If we can extract the right information from the files Instruments outputs, then we can construct flamecharts to help us build intuition for what’s happening while our code is executing.

**How Developers Power eBay’s Product-Based Shopping Experience**  
https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/blogs/tech/powering-ebays-product-based-shopping-experience/

https://code.facebook.com/posts/1461914677288302/open-sourcing-sonar-a-new-extensible-debugging-tool/  
Sonar has enabled Facebook engineers to more easily inspect the behavior of our applications. It has been used in many projects, but sample use cases include: Providing our engineers with access to a view hierarchy that more accurately resembles the features and functionality they are working with, by showing Litho and ComponentKit components; Surfacing a stream of GraphQL requests, as opposed to raw network events; Tracking performance markers in real time, allowing developers to more easily investigate performance problems.

**Metacat: Making Big Data Discoverable and Meaningful at Netflix**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/metacat-making-big-data-discoverable-and-meaningful-at-netflix-56fb36a53520  
At Netflix, our data warehouse consists of a large number of data sets stored in Amazon S3 (via Hive), Druid, Elasticsearch, Redshift, Snowflake and MySql. Our platform supports Spark, Presto, Pig, and Hive for consuming, processing and producing data sets. Given the diverse set of data sources, and to make sure our data platform can interoperate across these data sets as one “single” data warehouse, we built Metacat. In this blog, we will discuss our motivations in building Metacat, a metadata service to make data easy to discover, process and manage.

**Twitter meets TensorFlow**  
https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2018/twittertensorflow.html  
In this blog post, we will discuss the history, evolution, and future of our modeling/testing/serving framework, internally referred to as Deepbird, applying ML to Twitter data, and the challenges of serving ML in production settings. Indeed, Twitter handles large amounts of data and custom data formats. Twitter has a specific infrastructure stack, latency constraints, and a large request volume.

**The Problem with Patterns**  
http://alistapart.com/article/problem-with-patterns  
A design pattern library can range from being thorough, trying to cover all the bases, to politely broad, so as to not step on the toes of a design team. But patterns should never sacrifice user context for efficiency and consistency. They should reinforce the importance of the design process while helping an organization think more broadly about its users’ needs and its own goals. Real-world problems rarely are solved with out-of-the-box solutions. Even in service design.

**Emotional Design for data heavy apps**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/emotional-design-to-make-people-fall-in-love-with-data-heavy-apps-fde2bd5db500  
It is boring to see the data/statistics in the form of plain graphs or tables or pie charts. But, to represent the data in a way that is more scannable and logical we have to use these forms or representations. Specially in an environment where the customers have to look at the data daily and repeatedly to track status of their audience it is tough to get rid of these representations. In such situation, how can we improve the user experience? From my experience and from inspiration looking at online trends in UX, I wanted share few tips to improve the UI for a possible better UX.

**在美国模式之外，来见识下不甘平庸的「英伦式」科技创新**  
http://www.geekpark.net/news/230229  
如果硅谷为人们描绘出的未来图景是乐观至上、充满冒险意味，那么当我们来到「前沿之前」，就能发现英国创新者对于时间哲学的理解无形中渗透到了各个层面。无论是剑桥大学卡文迪许实验室、帝国理工大学哈姆林中心里正在攻克的课题方向，还是老牌跑车公司捷豹设计的一款新能源汽车，都在执着地平衡着前沿和人文、大胆创新和实际应用之间的关系。在这里，你几乎不会看到「风口」和「概念」，「能否解决实际问题，给人类带来更好的未来」是最重要的风向标。这也是几个世纪以来，英国推动技术社会进步的一贯思维体现。它看似少了锋芒，但如果我们必将要回答人类社会如何与技术共存的终极问题，这种典型的英式思考或许又是更先进和超前的，它值得被关注和重视。
