**Bringing collaborative editing to any application**  
https://ckeditor.com/blog/Bringing-collaborative-editing-to-any-application/  
Three years ago, we decided to face the challenge of making real-time, multi-user collaborative writing available for every software out there. That idea kicked off the development of CKEditor 5 and many other solutions now known as the CKEditor Ecosystem. In this article I give a quick overview of the problem we aim to solve, the solutions we developed for that purpose and how to approach collaborative editing in your application.

https://pro.ant.design/index-cn  
由 And Design 精心打磨 5 个月的作品，绝对的良心之作。Ant Design Pro 是一个开箱即用的企业级中后台前端/设计解决方案，致力于在设计规范和基础组件的基础上，继续向上构建，提炼出典型模板/业务组件/配套设计资源，进一步提升企业级中后台产品设计研发过程中的『用户』和『设计者』的体验。随着『设计者』的不断反馈，我们将持续迭代，逐步沉淀和总结出更多设计模式和相应的代码实现，阐述中后台产品模板/组件/业务场景的最佳实践。我们基于上述目标和提供了以下的典型模板，并据此构建了一套基于 React 的中后台管理控制台的脚手架，它可以帮助你快速搭建企业级中后台产品原型。

**面向未来的前端数据流框架 - dob**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/30664158  
dob 是利用 proxy 实现的数据依赖追踪工具，利用 dob-react 与 react 结合。dob 的核心思想大量借鉴了 mobx，但是从实现原理、使用便捷性，以及调试工具都做了大量优化。同时 dob 借鉴了 nx-js/observer-util 思想，但这个库仅仅停留在理论层面，实际使用中细节问题百出，dob 对其实现原理进行大幅修复，通过了多次实战考验。

**前端框架新选择——基于MVVM的San**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDE0Mjc4MA==&mid=2650998840&idx=1&sn=81f16c1a82c53a31c076c1c2d526e66d  
为了让几乎所有希望引入 MVVM 的 Web 前端业务场景在做技术选型的时，可以没有顾虑，百度 EFE TEAM 历时接近两年时间设计、开发 San 框架，一个实现了 MVVM 的 Web 组件化框架。在接近两年的时间里，它不断迭代，支撑了越来越多的业务。

**从Chrome源码看浏览器如何加载资源**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/30558018  
对浏览器加载资源有很多不确定性，例如：css/font的资源的优化级会比img高，资源的优化级是怎么确定的呢？资源优先级又是如何影响加载的先后顺序的？有几种情况可能会导致资源被阻止加载？通过源码可以找到答案。此次源码解读基于Chromium 64。

**腾讯QQ空间超分辨率技术TSR：为用户节省3/4流量，处理效果和速度超谷歌RAISR**  
https://www.leiphone.com/news/201710/c0GICjRacVyzHKIM.html  
TSR技术在同样的标准下，处理速度在RAISR的基础上提升了40%，处理效果也有明显提升。此外，TSR也是业界首次实现移动端使用深度神经网络进行超分辨率，并保证图片能够实时进行处理。即使在用户的普通Andriod手机，也可以使用这项技术。

**I Watched All of the Chrome Dev Summit 2017 Videos So You Don’t Have To**  
https://redfin.engineering/i-watched-all-of-the-chrome-dev-summit-2017-videos-so-you-dont-have-to-9b62a593c3cb  
Google wants you to build PWAs, reduce JavaScript file size, use Web Components, and configure autofill. They announced only a handful of features around payments, authentication, Android Trusted Web Activities, Chrome Dev Tools, and the Chrome User Experience Report.

**The VS Code Roadmap 2018**  
https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap  
As 2017 comes to an end, now is the time to look towards the future. We typically look out 6 to 12 months, establish a set of themes we want to work towards, and then schedule work each milestone supporting those themes.

**ORCHID - Access The World!**  
https://orchidprotocol.com/  
The Orchid Protocol is the decentralized, open-source technology for an Internet free from surveillance and censorship. Orchid combines its protocol with surplus bandwidth, state-of-the art-encryption, and a decentralized infrastructure to bring users surveillance-free access to the existing Internet. Because everyone is surveilled and bandwidth is ubiquitous, Orchid users can exchange bandwidth in peer-to-peer transactions using Orchid tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Ending the debate on inline functions in React**  
https://flexport.engineering/ending-the-debate-on-inline-functions-in-react-8c03fabd144  
Using inline functions in React is convenient but can be contentious because of their perceived impact on performance. Today Flexport is introducing our solution to the debate: a Babel transform called [reflective-bind](https://github.com/flexport/reflective-bind).

**Migrating Slack’s Desktop App to BrowserView**  
https://slack.engineering/growing-pains-migrating-slacks-desktop-app-to-browserview-2759690d9c7b  
We rewrote most of our Electron app to move from the janky webview to the new-fangled BrowserView. We managed to do it in a relatively short timeframe, thanks to a combination of elbow grease and reasonable choices in our client stack, like: Redux + redux-electron; Rx + redux-observable; TypeScript: Helps us refactor code quickly and correctly.

**A Minimalist Guide to SQLite**  
http://tech.marksblogg.com/sqlite3-tutorial-and-guide.html  
SQLite 3 isn't a toy. It's a powerful SQL-language interface enabler. As storage speeds and single core performance in CPUs increase the amount of data that can be sensibly handled within a reasonable time by SQLite 3 continues to grow.

**How We Identify and Stop Slow Latency Leaks at LinkedIn**  
[https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/10/fixing-the-plumbing-how-we-identify-and-stop-slow-latency-leaks](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/10/fixing-the-plumbing--how-we-identify-and-stop-slow-latency-leaks)  
At LinkedIn, we pay attention to site speed at every step of the release process, from code development to production ramp. But inevitably, the performance of our pages degrades over time (we use the word “pages” to denote webpages as well as mobile apps). In this post, we go over the tools and processes we use to catch and fix these degradations. While this is a post about automation to identify latency leaks, it is also a tale of how a human touch is still necessary.

**Web Typography: Designing Tables to be Read, Not Looked At**  
https://alistapart.com/article/web-typography-tables  
Good designers spend a great deal of time sweating over typography. They agonise over typefaces, iterate through type scales and meticulously apply white space, all in the service of the reader. Then comes along a table with the temptation to get creative, and all thoughts of the reader go out of the window. And yet tables are there to be read, referenced and used, not merely looked at.

**Sketching Interfaces - Generating code from low fidelity wireframes**  
https://airbnb.design/sketching-interfaces/  
The time required to test an idea should be zero. This was the very first sentence I wrote when considering the Airbnb design tools team vision. We believe that, within the next few years, emerging technology will allow teams to design new products in an expressive and intuitive way, while simultaneously eliminating hurdles from the product development process. Our team has begun exploring methods to bring testing time to zero. As we learn and build, we will be sharing what we’re working on here.

**10 UX Design Predictions For 2018**  
https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/10-ux-design-predictions-for-2018/  
We’re living in a time when design and user experience have never mattered more. The past decade of change shows us that design must constantly adapt as a discipline in order to meet user needs.While it’s impossible to see the future, we can still make some educated guesses about it. In this article, I go through some of the trends that will shape UX design in 2018 and, possibly, for several more years to come.

**复盘 Go 和 Docker ：他人观望时，如何抢占新技术先机**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4NTU2MTg3MQ==&mid=2655161775&idx=1&sn=d569ca87c15a938e15279598067e88e2

**“藤壶效应”：“白条粉”是如何干掉“铁丝”的**

“以客（用）户为中心”、“客户是上帝”之类的说法早已成为普遍的共识。与不少勿庸置疑的共识一样，这些说法细究起来是颇成问题的。热衷于“吸粉”的企业很容易忽略粉丝与粉丝间的巨大差异，很容易在不加分别地“善待客户”中，严重亏待真正为企业创造价值的客户，不知不觉地让企业的经营方向被无效客户牵引到雷区。

**[译]谷歌是怎么设计语音界面的 ？对话设计六原则**  
http://ued.baidu.com/486  
新时代的界面将会突破现有的格局。界面将不再被滑动、轻触和点击局限，取而代之的是更自然细腻的语言呈现形式。 用于GUI（图形用户界面）的设计技法和设计语言在语音交互这个全新的领域不再适用，VUI（语音用户界面）设计的新浪潮将基于『对话』- 这个我们最先学会而且最擅长的交流方式。本文给VUI设计师们介绍六项原则，这些原则是日常对话的延展。它们可以辅助设计师完成对话设计，并且引领VUI设计师进入以用户为中心的界面设计新时代。
