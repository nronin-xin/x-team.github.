**Announcing Yarn 1.0**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/274518539716230  
Yarn is now responsible for nearly 3 billion package downloads per month. Reduced install times are a big draw for many users. Twitter, as well as Microsoft on outlook.com, have seen improvements of 5x in install times. Expo, Kenzan, and Sentry have reported performance and stability improvements so they can ship code faster. Here at Facebook, Yarn has been adopted across many codebases including the main Facebook app and website, Instagram, Oculus, and WhatsApp. Yarn supports hundreds of thousands of package installs on our systems every day. It was designed to scale even when a project has hundreds or thousands of direct or transitive dependencies. 附：[It’s OK to not use Yarn](https://hackernoon.com/its-ok-to-not-use-yarn-f28dc766ef32)

**DOM Attributes in React 16**  
https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/09/08/dom-attributes-in-react-16.html  
In the past, React used to ignore unknown DOM attributes. If you wrote JSX with an attribute that React doesn't recognize, React would just skip it. In React 16, we are making a change. Now, any unknown attributes will end up in the DOM. 

**Nginx Unit**  
https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-unit/  
NGINX Unit is a new, lightweight, open source application server built to meet the demands of today’s dynamic and distributed applications. Deploy configuration changes with no service disruptions. Run code in multiple languages. Build the foundation of your service mesh.

**Micro Frontends**  
https://micro-frontends.org/  
Techniques, strategies and recipes for building a modern web app with multiple teams using different JavaScript frameworks. The idea behind Micro Frontends is to think about a website or web app as a composition of features which are owned by independent teams. Each team has a distinct area of business or mission it cares about and specialises in. A team is cross functional and develops its features end-to-end, from database to user interface.

**Introducing Fastify, a Speedy Node.js Web Framework**  
https://thenewstack.io/introducing-fastify-speedy-node-js-web-framework/  
Fastify is a new web framework inspired by Hapi, Restify and Express. Fastify is built as a general-purpose web framework, but it shines when building extremely fast HTTP APIs that use JSON as the data format. These are extremely common in both web and mobile software architectures, so Fastify could improve the throughput of the majority of applications.

**A 6-Step-Guide for Contributing to the Node.js Core**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/contributing-to-the-node-js-core/  
The aim of this article is to help you land your first commit to the Node.js core! Contributing to Node.js can be done in a lot of different ways. You can start contributing to one of the working groups (like the Website, Diagnostics or Post-mortem group) or start teaching at Nodeschools, so your peers can learn from you. You can also start working directly on the Node.js Core, whether you do it by answering questions, or actually adding code to the project.

**Diving deep into JavaScript array – evolution & performance**  
http://voidcanvas.com/javascript-array-evolution-performance/  
The article is more about memory representation, optimization, behavior differences over syntaxes, performance and the recent evolution.  Introduction of typed array in JavaScript is a great step. Int8Array, Uint8Array, Uint8ClampedArray, Int16Array, Uint16Array, Int32Array, Uint32Array, Float32Array, Float64Array etc are typed array views, who are in native byte order.

**Optimizing web servers for high throughput and low latency**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2017/09/optimizing-web-servers-for-high-throughput-and-low-latency/  
The Dropbox edge network is an nginx-based proxy tier designed to handle both latency-sensitive metadata transactions and high-throughput data transfers. In a system that is handling tens of gigabits per second while simultaneously processing tens of thousands latency-sensitive transactions, there are efficiency/performance optimizations throughout the proxy stack, from drivers and interrupts, through TCP/IP and kernel, to library, and application level tunings.

**Rapid release at massive scale**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/270314900139291/rapid-release-at-massive-scale/  
We decided to move facebook.com to a quasi-continuous “push from master” system in April 2016. Over the next year, we gradually rolled it out, first to 50 percent of employees, then from 0.1 percent to 1 percent to 10 percent of production web traffic. Each of these progressions allowed us to test the ability of our tools and processes to handle the increased push frequency and get real-world signal. Our main goal was to make sure that the new system made people’s experience better — or at the very least, didn’t make it worse. After almost exactly a year of planning and development, over the course of three days in April 2017 we enabled 100 percent of our production web servers to run code deployed directly from master.

**LogDevice: a distributed data store for logs**  
https://code.facebook.com/posts/357056558062811/logdevice-a-distributed-data-store-for-logs/  
The relaxed data model of LogDevice allowed us to reach more optimal points in the trade-off space of availability, durability, and performance than what would be possible for a distributed file system strictly adhering to the POSIX semantics, or for a log store built on top of such a file system.

**The State of the Web - A guide to impactful performance improvements**  
https://medium.com/@fox/talk-the-state-of-the-web-3e12f8e413b3  
Only 46% of 7.4 billion people on this planet have access to the Internet. The average network speed caps at unimpressive 7Mb/s. More importantly, 93% of Internet users are going online through mobile devices — it becomes inexcusable to not cater to handhelds. Our websites aren’t in a perfect shape either — the average site is the size of original Doom game (approx. 3 MB).

**Rise of Functions as a Service: How PHP Set the “Serverless” Stage 20 Years Ago**  
https://medium.com/@keithwhor/rise-of-functions-as-a-service-how-php-set-the-serverless-stage-20-years-ago-ccb560c5f422   
With all of this innovation, it’s worthwhile to take a step down memory lane and look at how an unlikely candidate, PHP, brought us all the way to modern “serverless” architecture.

**How is ARCore better than ARKit?**  
https://medium.com/super-ventures-blog/how-is-arcore-better-than-arkit-5223e6b3e79d  
I think as a technical solution they are very very close in capability. Effectively indistinguishable to users when it comes to the user experiences you can build today. ARKit has some tech advantages around hw/sw integration and more reliable tracking. ARCore has some advantages around mapping and more reliable recovery. Both of these advantages are mostly only noticeable by Computer Vision engineers who know what to look for. 附：[四分钟内明白 ARCore + 上手](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAwODY4OTk2Mg==&mid=2652044627&idx=1&sn=650265fd1d7023b95fb043432d7ecbe3)

**Every Programmer Should Know**  
https://github.com/mr-mig/every-programmer-should-know  
A collection of (mostly) technical things every software developer should know. You don't need to know all of that by heart to be a programmer. But knowing the stuff will help you become better!

**A Guide To Virtual Reality For Web Developers**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/09/guide-virtual-reality-web-developers/  
Recently, there has been a proliferation of virtual reality (VR) web browsers and VR capabilities added to traditional browsers. In this article, we’ll look at the state of browsers in VR and the state of VR on the web via the WebVR APIs.

**Working with Schemas in WordPress**  
https://css-tricks.com/working-with-schemas-wordpress/  
If you're unfamiliar with schemas, they are HTML attributes that help search engines understand the content structure and know how to display it correctly in search engine results. We're going to dig into the concept of schemas a little more in this post and then walk through a real-life application of how to use them in a WordPress environment.

**Flat UI Elements Attract Less Attention and Cause Uncertainty**  
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-ui-less-attention-cause-uncertainty/  
Flat interfaces often use weak signifiers. In an eyetracking experiment comparing different kinds of clickability clues, UIs with weak signifiers required more user effort than strong ones.

**The React license for founders and CTOs**  
https://medium.com/@ji/the-react-license-for-founders-and-ctos-b38d2538f3e5  
I worked at Facebook several years ago during some influential events, including a major patent lawsuit and the open-source release of React. To my knowledge, Facebook has never proactively sued anyone for infringing its patents. I’ve heard some concerns that the BSD+Patents license might make companies using React less attractive as acquisition targets, but most of the top tech acquirers are already using React and other Facebook open source in some way.

**What is NextQL**  
https://codeburst.io/what-is-nextql-5ca4193795ea  
NextQL is a JSON query language for APIs and an extensible runtime for fulfilling those queries. It equivalent with Facebook’s GraphQL but much simpler. There are a lot of topics about GraphQL and GraphQL vs REST. I’m not going say it again. In short, FB’s GraphQL or Netflix’s Falcor or my NextQL or REST serve a same purpose. It is a tool for client query and manipulate data efficiently.
