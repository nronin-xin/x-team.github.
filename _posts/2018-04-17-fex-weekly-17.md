**Front-End Developer Handbook 2018**  
https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/  
This is a guide that anyone could use to learn about the practice of front-end development. It broadly outlines and discusses the practice of front-end engineering: how to learn it and what tools are used when practicing it in 2018. The book should not be considered a comprehensive outline of all resources available to a front-end developer. The value of the book is tied up in a terse, focused, and timely curation of just enough categorical information so as not to overwhelm anyone on any one particular subject matter.

**Crafting Interpreters**  
http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/  
This book contains everything you need to implement a full-featured, efficient scripting language. You’ll learn both high-level concepts around parsing and semantics and gritty details like bytecode representation and garbage collection. Your brain will light up with new ideas, and your hands will get dirty and calloused. It’s gonna be a blast.

**Node.js can HTTP/2 push!**  
https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/node-js-can-http-2-push-b491894e1bb1  
Since introducing HTTP/2 into Node.js 8 in July of 2017, the implementation has undergone several rounds of improvements. Now we’re almost ready to lift the “experimental” flag. It’s best to try out HTTP/2 support with Node.js version 9, which has all the latest fixes and improvements. 另附：[V8 6.6 Landed on Node.js Core](https://github.com/nodejs/node/compare/78cd8263354705b767ef8c6a651740efe4931ba0...82e475dc75751df08d80bd6e25926bd25c1794f2), [npm Acquires ^Lift Security and Node Security Platform](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/172793182214/npm-acquires-lift-security-and-node-security).

**JavaScript and Node.js Security – The Common Pitfalls**  
https://snyk.io//blog/javascript-and-nodejs-security-the-common-pitfalls/  
JavaScript and Node.js have shown themselves to be amazing platforms. Their sheer ease of use has empowered an entire community of creative individuals to build amazing things. Like in all cases, however, amongst the goodness lurk some risks. Nobody’s perfect, including Node.js and JavaScript, and a language’s strength can quickly translate to its vulnerability if looked through through an evil (or paranoid) lens. I’ve given many talks about JavaScript security, looking to do my share in raising awareness and to keep our applications safer.

https://dev.to/remojansen/implementing-the-onion-architecture-in-nodejs-with-typescript-and-inversifyjs-10ad  
In this article, we are going to describe an architecture known as the onion architecture. The onion architecture is a software application architecture that adheres to the SOLID principles. It uses the dependency injection principle extensively, and it is profoundly influenced by the Domain Driven Design (DDD) principles and some functional programming principles.

**Automated Canary Analysis at Netflix with Kayenta**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/automated-canary-analysis-at-netflix-with-kayenta-3260bc7acc69  
We have open sourced [Kayenta](https://github.com/spinnaker/kayenta), a platform for Automated Canary Analysis (ACA). Kayenta leverages lessons learned over the years of delivering rapid and reliable changes into production at Netflix. It is a crucial component of delivery at Netflix as it reduces the risk from making changes in our production environment. In addition, Kayenta has increased developer productivity by providing engineers with a high degree of trust in their deployments.

**Looking to Listen: Audio-Visual Speech Separation**  
https://research.googleblog.com/2018/04/looking-to-listen-audio-visual-speech.html  
People are remarkably good at focusing their attention on a particular person in a noisy environment, mentally “muting” all other voices and sounds. Known as the cocktail party effect, this capability comes natural to us humans. However, automatic speech separation — separating an audio signal into its individual speech sources — while a well-studied problem, remains a significant challenge for computers.

**Why SQLite Does Not Use Git**  
https://sqlite.org/whynotgit.html  
SQLite does not use the Git version control system. SQLite uses Fossil instead, which is a version control system that was specifically designed and written to support SQLite. People sometimes ask why SQLite does not use the Git version control system like everybody else. This article attempts to answer that question. Also, in section 3, this article provides hints to Git users about how they can easily access the SQLite source code.

**The Mathematics of 2048: Optimal Play with Markov Decision Processes**  
http://jdlm.info/articles/2018/03/18/markov-decision-process-2048.html  
In this post, we’ll use a mathematical framework called a Markov Decision Process to find provably optimal strategies for 2048 when played on the 2x2 and 3x3 boards, and also on the 4x4 board up to the 64 tile.

**WHY DOES "=" MEAN ASSIGNMENT?**  
https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/equals-as-assignment/  
The usual answer is “because of C”. But that’s just passing the buck: why does C do it that way? Let’s find out!

**GitHub 10 years**  
https://blog.github.com/2018-04-10-ten-years-of-code/  
On this day 10 years ago, GitHub officially went live. We started with a pretty simple purpose: to connect developers and make it easier for them to work together on projects with Git. In the last decade, we’ve evolved as a company and as a platform, but the reason why GitHub exists is fundamentally the same. What makes this platform special isn’t an idea or an invention. It’s the people using it—and GitHub is celebrating 10 years because of you, our community.

**CKEditor 5 v1.0.0 beta released**

**How To Design Emotional Interfaces For Boring Apps**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/04/designing-emotional-interfaces-boring-apps/  
Humans can’t endure boredom for a long time, which is why products that are built for non-exciting, repetitive tasks so often get abandoned and gather dust on computers and phones. But boredom, according to psychologists, is merely lack of stimulation, the unfulfilled desire for satisfying activity. So what if we use the interface to give them that stimulation? I sat with product designers here at MacPaw, who spend their waking hours designing not-so-sexy things like duplicate finders and encryption apps, and they shared five secrets to more emotional UIs: gamification, humor, animation, illustration, and mascots.

**Brutalist design is the bad influence we all need**  
https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/why-we-need-web-brutalism/  
The UX/UI world has gradually come to be dominated by guidelines and aesthetics belonging to companies like Apple or Google. It’s absolutely normal and predictable that this would happen, considering most apps are designed to seamlessly fit into the user experience of technologies belonging to these big titans.

**Top 3 Things Charter Learned About Reusable Designs and Components**  
https://blog.angular.io/top-3-things-charter-learned-about-reusable-designs-and-components-dd367de32122  
Modern web app development is complicated. Even when you go it alone, you’re faced with innumerable decisions. Which libraries and frameworks will you choose? How will you structure your code? What syntax rules will you follow? How will you build and deploy the app?

**Color: From Hexcodes to Eyeballs**  
http://jamie-wong.com/post/color/  
Why do we perceive background-color: #9B51E0 as this particular purple? This is one of those questions where I thought I’d known the answer for a long time, but as I inspected my understanding, I realized there were pretty significant gaps. Through an exploration of electromagnetic radiation, optical biology, colorimetry, and display hardware, I hope to start filling in some of these gaps.

**Publishers Haven't Realized Just How Big a Deal GDPR is**  
https://baekdal.com/strategy/publishers-havent-realized-just-how-big-a-deal-gdpr-is/  
So, in this article, I'm going to talk about GDPR as a concept in relation to media trends, and consider what this means for your editorial strategies. I hope I can help you realize just how big a change this actually is.

**It'S Time For An Rss Revival**  
https://www.wired.com/story/rss-readers-feedly-inoreader-old-reader/  
THE MODERN WEB contains no shortage of horrors, from ubiquitous ad trackers to all-consuming platforms to YouTube comments, generally. Unfortunately, there's no panacea for what ails this internet we've built. But anyone weary of black-box algorithms controlling what you see online at least has a respite, one that's been there all along but has often gone ignored. Tired of Twitter? Facebook fatigued? It's time to head back to RSS.

**Hello: A new social network founded by Orkut's creator**  
http://www.orkut.com/index.html  
hello is the first social network built on loves, not likes. I designed hello to help you connect with people who share your passions. hello connects us all. Think about it: you can say "hello" in any language and people will understand. "Hello" is probably the most widely spoken word in the world after "Okay." Aló, halo, ʾāllo, alô, hallo, alló, hello. Fear and hatred have no place when you make such a simple and friendly gesture to someone else. So come join me, and make some new friends. Say hello, and love your world.

**How To Be a Systems Thinker**  
https://www.edge.org/conversation/mary_catherine_bateson-how-to-be-a-systems-thinker  
At the moment, I’m asking myself how people think about complex wholes like the ecology of the planet, or the climate, or large populations of human beings that have evolved for many years in separate locations and are now re-integrating. To think about these things, I find that you need something like systems theory. So, I went back to thinking about systems theory two or three years ago, which I hadn’t for quite a long time.

**[译]增长黑客 VS 价值黑客**  
http://36kr.com/p/5128132.html  
专注于一个指标，并试图不惜一切代价将其提高，是实现增长的合理途径吗？在工程师拉杰德拉 · 拉斯马纳（Rajendra Rusmana）看来，这种做法偏离了产品的本质——为用户提供价值。按照这种方式去推动增长，必然会到达瓶颈，因为增长黑客本质上是一个最优化问题。为了突破这个瓶颈，应该将目光转移到价值上，成为一个价值黑客。
