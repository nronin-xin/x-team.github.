**The Cost Of JavaScript In 2018**  
https://medium.com/@addyosmani/the-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4  
Byte-for-byte, JavaScript is still the most expensive resource we send to mobile phones, because it can delay interactivity in large ways. Today we’ll cover some strategies you can use to deliver JavaScript efficiently while still giving users a valuable experience.

**Introducing Fusion.js: A Plugin-based Universal Web Framework**  
https://eng.uber.com/fusionjs/  
A little-known fact is that Uber builds a lot of web-based applications, hundreds of them and counting, in fact. Many of them are internal apps for managing various aspects of the business while others are public facing. A more well-known fact is that web technologies change quickly and best practices are constantly evolving. Providing a high quality framework with modern features to hundreds of web engineers while keeping up with the dynamic nature of the web platform has historically been a challenge. To address this challenge, Uber’s Web Platform team built Fusion.js, an open source web framework that makes web development easier and produces lightweight, high-performing apps.

**A Look Ahead: Web Development Predictions**  
http://blog.wolksoftware.com/a-look-ahead-web-development-predictions  
In this post, I would like to share some predictions about the world of web development. Making predictions is dangerous because there are high chances that they will be wrong. However, I enjoy thinking about the future because it is exciting and it can help us to identify potential future career opportunities. Remember that all innovations start as a fantasy.

**React v16.4.2: Server-side vulnerability fix**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/08/01/react-v-16-4-2.html  
We discovered a minor vulnerability that might affect some apps using ReactDOMServer. We are releasing a patch version for every affected React minor release so that you can upgrade with no friction. Read on for more details.

**Node.js：浅析高并发与分布式集群**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/41118827  
虽然 Node 的单线程特性给其提供的服务带来了许多问题，但只要我们积极面对这些问题，用合理的方法（如使用 child_process 等模块或构建分布式集群）去解决他们，发挥 Node 的各种优势，就可以享受到它所带来的好处！

**Node 案发现场揭秘 —— Coredump 还原线上异常**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/41178823  
Node.js 发展到今天，已经被越来越广泛地应用到 BFF 前后端分离 、 全栈开发 、 客户端工具 等领域。然而，相对于应用层的蓬勃发展，其 Runtime 对于绝大部分前端出身的开发者来说，处于黑盒的状态，这一点并没有得到很好的改善，从而也阻碍了 Node.js 在业务中的应用和推广。本文将介绍一种基于 Core dump 来分析定位线上应用故障的方法。

**Flexbox，终于可以承认自己明白了**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5NzkwNDk3MQ==&mid=2650587826&idx=1&sn=785aa994a3f046f55c21b2c147863967  
Flex 针对容器的属性非常容易理解，而针对可伸缩项的属性则不好理解。更确切地说，是flex-grow、flex-shrink和flex-basis属性不好理解。只有理解了这三个属性，你才能说自己真正理解了Flexbox。

**Jenkins的Pipeline脚本在美团餐饮SaaS中的实践**  
https://tech.meituan.com/erp_cd_jenkins_pipeline.html  
Jenkins构建也有很多种方式，现在使用比较多的是自由风格的软件项目（Jenkins构建的一种方式，会结合SCM和构建系统来构建你的项目，甚至可以构建软件以外的系统）的方式。针对单个项目的简单构建，这种方式已经足够了，但是针对多个类似且又存在差异的项目，就难以满足要求，否则就需要大量的job来支持，这就存在，一个小的变动，就需要修改很多个job的情况，难以维护。我们团队之前就存在这样的问题。本文是分享一种Pipeline的使用经验，来解决这类问题。

**Google announces Grab and Go program for Chromebooks, powered by Angular**  
https://blog.angular.io/google-announces-grab-and-go-program-for-chromebooks-powered-by-angular-7954c11900bd  
Last week at Google Cloud Next, the Grab and Go team showed off their newly announced Grab and Go program: a self service program for enterprises to automate managing Chromebook assets. An Angular application powers this program which automatically manages Chromebook assignments based on user logins. All of Google’s internal loaner Chromebook fleet is managed with this program, serving 30,000 unique users and over 100,000 loans last year.

**I created the exact same app in React and Vue. Here are the differences**  
https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/i-created-the-exact-same-app-in-react-and-vue-here-are-the-differences-e9a1ae8077fd  
I’d read the React docs and watched a few tutorial videos and, while they were great and all, what I really wanted to know was how different React was from Vue. By “different”, I didn’t mean things such as whether they both had virtual DOMS or how they went about rendering pages. I wanted someone to take the time to explain the code and to tell me what was going on! I wanted to find an article that took the time to explain these differences so that someone new to either Vue or React (or Web Development as a whole) could gain a better understanding of the differences between the two.

**Introducing Clinic Bubbleprof, a unique way to visualise Node.js code**  
https://www.nearform.com/blog/introducing-clinic-bubbleprof-a-unique-way-to-visualise-node-js-code/  
In a nutshell, Bubbleprof observes the async operations of your application, groups them, measures their delays, and draws a map of the delays in your application’s async flow. The real power of the tool was demonstrated recently where it uncovered inefficiencies in both the Fastify web framework and in Node.js Core itself! The team has written a deep-dive blogpost into the features, technology and usage of Bubbleprof. In this post I want to cover some high level topics.

Even though the details may change, future releases will support modules defined using Go 1.11 or vgo.

**Learning From Terminals to Design the Future of User Interfaces**  
https://brandur.org/interfaces  
A successful interface isn’t one that looks good in a still screenshot, it’s one that maximizes our productivity and lets us keep moving. Legibility and whitespace are great, but they’re of vanishing unimportance compared to speed and responsiveness. Neither a terminal nor today’s web apps are what the future should look like, but the terminal is closer.

https://blog.marvelapp.com/rules-of-effective-ux-writing/  
UX writing is the practice of crafting UI copy that guides users within a product and helps them interact with it. UI copy includes buttons and menu labels, error messages, security notes, terms and conditions, as well as any instructions on product usage. The primary aim of UX writing is to settle communication between users and a digital product. In this article, I’ll provide some practical tips on effective UX writing.

**Learning Dexterity**  
https://blog.openai.com/learning-dexterity/  
We’ve trained a human-like robot hand to manipulate physical objects with unprecedented dexterity. Our system, called Dactyl, is trained entirely in simulation and transfers its knowledge to reality, adapting to real-world physics using techniques we’ve been working on for the past year. Dactyl learns from scratch using the same general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithm and code as OpenAI Five. Our results show that it’s possible to train agents in simulation and have them solve real-world tasks, without physically-accurate modeling of the world.

**How Technology Grows (a restatement of definite optimism)**  
https://danwang.co/how-technology-grows/  
I submit that we have two big biases when we talk about technology. First, we think about it too much in terms of tools and recipes, when really we should think about it more in terms of process knowledge and technical experience. Second, most of us focus too much on the digital world and not enough on the industrial world. Our obsession with the digital world has pushed our expectation of the technological future in the direction of cyberpunk dystopia; I hope instead that we can look forward to a joyful vision of the technological future, driven by advances in industry. This is one of my longer essays; the final section summarizes the main points.

当我们提起今日头条的时候，大多数人会聊他算法推荐的优势，会聊起他与腾讯之间的纷纷扰扰以及张一鸣那句：“创立今日头条不是为了成为“腾讯”的员工。”但实际上，很少有人细致的研究过今日头条在发展历程中的一些特点，以及那套支持头条高速成长的产品方法论。
