**Google publishes a JavaScript style guide. Here are some key lessons**  
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/google-publishes-a-javascript-style-guide-here-are-some-key-lessons-1810b8ad050b  
Google puts out [a style guide for writing JavaScript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) that lays out (what Google believes to be) the best stylistic practices for writing clean, understandable code. Google and Airbnb have two of the most popular style guides out there. I’d definitely recommend you check out both of them if you spend much time writing JS. The following are thirteen of what I think are the most interesting and relevant rules from Google’s JS Style Guide.

**React v16.3.0: New lifecycles and context API**

**Redux - Not Dead Yet!**  
http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2018/03/redux-not-dead-yet/  
Some clarification on what's going on with Redux. I'm a Redux maintainer. There's been a lot of confusion, claims, and misinformation about Redux going around lately, and I want to help clear things up. Is Redux dead, dying, deprecated, or about to be replaced? No. Are there situations where you don't need Redux? Sure, but that's always been true.

**ESLint + Prettier For a Consistent React Codebase**  
https://blog.gojekengineering.com/eslint-prettier-for-a-consistent-react-codebase-eaa673debb1d  
In this post I’m going to assume we are building a React app with create-react-app, although most of the concepts here are applicable to any Javascript development.

**ES modules: A cartoon deep-dive**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/

A webinar discussing new advances in web layout techniques that will impact web designers and developers in the near future.

**How display: contents; Works**  
https://bitsofco.de/how-display-contents-works/  
What happens when you use display: contents? The easiest way to understand what happens when display: contents is used is to imagine the element’s opening and closing tags being omitted from the markup. 

**w descriptors and sizes: Under the hood**  
https://beta.observablehq.com/@eeeps/w-descriptors-and-sizes-under-the-hood  
If you’re not familiar with srcset, w descriptors, and sizes, the best, shortest guide to what you should put where when you’re just trying to put a dang image on a dang website might be this one, from Jake Archibald. Go! Read it! If you already know your way around the whats and the whys of this markup, you might not know exactly how browsers use it to load images responsively. The mechanics are interesting, and have some confounding side effects.

**Introducing Cloud Text-to-Speech powered by DeepMind WaveNet technology**  
https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/03/introducing-Cloud-Text-to-Speech-powered-by-Deepmind-WaveNet-technology.html
Many Google products (e.g., the Google Assistant, Search, Maps) come with built-in high-quality text-to-speech synthesis that produces natural sounding speech. Developers have been telling us they’d like to add text-to-speech to their own applications, so today we’re bringing this technology to Google Cloud Platform with Cloud Text-to-Speech.

**Data Science and the Art of Producing Entertainment at Netflix**  
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/studio-production-data-science-646ee2cc21a1  
Netflix has released hundreds of Originals and plans to spend $8 billion over the next year on content. Creators of these stories pour their hearts and souls into turning ideas into joy for our viewers. The sublime art of doing this well is hard to describe, but it necessitates a careful orchestration of creative, business and technical decisions. Here we will focus on the latter two — business & technical decisions like planning budgets, finding locations, building sets, and scheduling guest actors that enable the creative act of connecting with viewers.

**Scheduling Jekyll posts with Netlify and AWS**  
https://www.nczonline.net/blog/2018/03/scheduling-jekyll-posts-netlify/  
This post assumes you already have a site setup on Netlify using a GitHub repository. While I assume the solution works the same for other source code repository types, like BitBucket, I'm not entirely sure. This post also assumes that you have an AWS account.

**git log – the Good Parts**  
https://zwischenzugs.com/2018/03/26/git-log-the-good-parts/  
If you’re managing a complex git codebase with multiple developers, then you may well be using a tool like GitHub or BitBucket to delve into the history and figure out branch and merge issues. These GUIs are great for providing a nice user interface for managing pull requests and simple histories and the like, but when the workflow SHTF there’s no substitute for using git log and its relatively little-known flags to really dig into the situation.

**UX In Contact Forms: Essentials To Turn Leads Into Conversions**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/ux-contact-forms-essentials-conversions/

In this article, we'll take a look at the most common questions of design trainees in our company. Below are FAQs and answers on how to make website forms user-friendly, as well as tips to prevent low user interaction.

**Animated Transitions in Mobile Apps**  
https://uxplanet.org/animated-transitions-in-mobile-apps-412b8e8478e7  
Animation is a big part of user experience. When it comes to transitions in mobile apps, there are a lot of things you can communicate very subtly with animation. Send the message, open Settings, check the box, navigate to another page — these are all moments of change. Animating a transition is an excellent way to reinforce the user’s action. In this article, we’ll review the common cases when functional animation can complement the visual design and support interactions.

**Polishing GitLab’s UI: A new color system**  
https://about.gitlab.com/2018/03/29/polishing-gitlabs-ui-a-new-color-system/  
We receive a lot of feedback from our users and the broader community. After hearing that there is a perceived lack of consistency and quality in GitLab’s UI, we decided to take a look at our color palette. Aesthetic aspects like this are a fundamental part of the UI. If we don’t get these right, everything else in the UI won’t feel, look, or behave correctly. Like a house, these aesthetics are the foundation upon which everything else is built.

https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/03/31/mozilla-turns-twenty/  
There is plenty to do going forward to build a healthier internet that has better human experiences. There’s no detailed map — we’ll build that together. We’ll go forwards, sideways, and in circles. It’s an adventure, and probably not for the faint-hearted. But for those who love the adventure, thrive on change, and want to be remembered for building decent values into great products and programs – for us, there’s no better place to be.

**为什么说MVP已死，MAP当道**  
https://www.uisdc.com/minimum-awesome-product  
MAP ：最低完成度但足够能让人惊艳的产品。现在这个时代，当你在考虑一个产品的发展（不管是实体的还是网站，还是 app 等等），你不应该只问自己「这是我能让这个产品可行的最基本的形态么？」这个一开始看起来好像是对的问题，但是当我们抛出以下的问题时你会发现现在都没办法这么做了。MAP 产品到底要做到多好，要看你的目标行业的竞争产品的情况，如果根本就没有什么竞争产品，那么MVP = MAP；如果已经有很多竞争者了，那么 MAP > MVP。

创业是一个非常复杂的课题，甚至于一个混沌的课题。这对创始人来说，尤其认知能力的要求，是极其苛刻的。面对未知的世界，我们永远要像小学生一样，保持好奇；面对新物种新规律，要像海绵一样，保持空杯，不断吸收。如同一位作者形容，每天扑在未知的知识，就像饥饿的人扑在面包上一样。另附：[曾鸣：创始人最难迈过的坎是什么？](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxNTAzNzU0Ng==&mid=2654597723&idx=1&sn=b94f11b1be208862ac5b8d53730b0b09)

对于科学，我们需要耐得住寂寞，能不在意名利，我们要有足够的耐心，我们需要有人去做那些“吃饱了撑的”无用之事。“科学是神奇的。它是人类发现世界、探知万物——当然也包括了解我们自己的最好途径。”我们最欠缺的，是一种需要代代相传的精神：愿意为自己无法享用的树荫去种树。
