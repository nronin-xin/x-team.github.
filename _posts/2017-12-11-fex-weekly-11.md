**Introducing the React RFC Process**  
https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/12/07/introducing-the-react-rfc-process.html  
We’re adopting an RFC (“request for comments”) process for contributing ideas to React. Inspired by Yarn, Ember, and Rust, the goal is to allow React core team members and community members to collaborate on the design of new features.

**React Performance Fixes on Airbnb Listing Pages**  
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/recent-web-performance-fixes-on-airbnb-listing-pages-6cd8d93df6f4  
Through a process of profiling, making a fix, and profiling again, we dramatically improved the interaction performance of this critical page, which makes the booking experience smoother and more satisfying. In this post, you’ll learn about the techniques I used to profile this page, the tools I used to optimize it, and see the scale of this impact in the flame charts produced by my profiling.

**Patterns for designing flexible architecture in node.js (CQRS/ES/Onion)**  
https://medium.com/@domagojk/patterns-for-designing-flexible-architecture-in-node-js-cqrs-es-onion-7eb10bbefe17  
In this post, I’ve presented a project that is using CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns. It’s organized using onion architecture and written with TypeScript.  附：[从CQS向CQRS演变](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIwMzg1ODcwMw==&mid=2247487200&idx=1&sn=4650baf9462415d83a9c74e73455f019)  

**Introducing Nexus.js: A multi-threaded JavaScript run-time**  
https://dev.to/voodooattack/introducing-nexusjs-a-multi-threaded-javascript-run-time-3g6  
Last year I started implementing Nexus.js, a multi-threaded server-side JavaScript run-time based on WebKit/JavaScriptCore. I dropped it for a while, due to circumstances out of my control that I'm not going to discuss here, but here we are again: I couldn't keep myself from working on it for long. So let us start by discussing the architecture of Nexus and how things work.

**Products Over Projects**  
https://martinfowler.com/articles/products-over-projects.html  
Product-mode instead uses durable, ideate-build-run teams working on a persistent business issue. Product-mode allows teams to reorient quickly, reduces their end-to-end cycle time, and allows validation of actual benefits by using short-cycle iterations while maintaining the architectural integrity of their software to preserve their long-term effectiveness.

**码农·打破“性能”瓶颈（第31期）**  
http://www.ituring.com.cn/book/2589

**设计师如何有效参与团队协作**  
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/31592558  
工作中的沟通效果很多时候直接决定了你的设计方案会不会被采纳，对一个优秀的设计师而言，仅仅做好自己的产出是不够的，还要能够说服大家接受自己的方案，推动资源去做正确的事，这时沟通能力、耐力就显得非常重要。

**A different way of understanding this in JavaScript**  
http://2ality.com/2017/12/alternate-this.html  
In this blog post, I take a different approach to explaining this in JavaScript: I pretend that arrow functions are the real functions and ordinary functions a special construct for methods. I think it makes this easier to understand – give it a try.

**Here’s what people in tech had to say about JavaScript when it debuted in 1995**   
https://medium.com/dailyjs/heres-what-people-in-tech-had-to-say-about-javascript-when-it-debuted-in-1995-a4b81dc05b71  
ime and time again JavaScript is crowned the most popular programming language in the World. Whether you agree with that or not, one thing’s for sure: It’s come a long way since its debut back in 1995. 另附：

**The Glimmer Binary Experience**  
https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/12/the-glimmer-binary-experience  
A bit over a year ago, Ember.js got a major overhaul. In a tight collaboration between LinkedIn engineers and the open source community, we replaced Ember’s rendering engine with a new library, Glimmer VM, that improved performance and significantly reduced the size of compiled templates. In this blog, we will discuss a recent experiment to improve load times even further by entirely eliminating the cost to parse compiled templates.

**Uber’s Open Source Tool for Preventing Resource Exhaustion by DNS Outages**  
https://eng.uber.com/denial-by-dns/  
In this article, we strive to answer the question: how can a third-party service degrade data center-local (or even host-local) connectivity of a web service? While this login service has been deprecated, our experience led us to create a new solution for identifying and preventing these types of outages.

**Neural Networks in JavaScript with deeplearn.js**  
https://www.robinwieruch.de/neural-networks-deeplearnjs-javascript/  
This article will not explain the machine learning algorithms in detail, but only demonstrate their usage in JavaScript. The course on the other hand goes into detail and explains these algorithms in an amazing quality. At this point in time of writing the article, I learn about the topic myself and try to internalize my learnings by writing about them and applying them in JavaScript. 另附：[Google大神 Jeff Dean - Machine Learning for Systems and Systems for Machine Learning](http://t.cn/RTZFist)

**A Look at the Improvements That TLS 1.3 Brings**  
https://www.keycdn.com/blog/tls-1-3/  
TLS 1.3 has numerous other improvements over its predecessors. This guide will explain how developers can take full advantage of the features the latest version of TLS has to offer. Many browsers and SSL test services do not yet support TLS 1.3. The situation should change very soon, but in the meantime, you can enable the security protocol manually in some versions of Firefox and Chrome.

**Using GopherJS with gRPC-Web**  
https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2017/gopherjs-grpc-web/  
Writing GopherJS apps is great fun and lets us avoid writing JavaScript and all the problems associated with it. However, we’ll often want to communicate with a backend server in order to read or write state or issue RPC calls to other backend servers. This is generally done via a RESTful JSON API, or maybe something like GraphQL with JSON. 

**Modern Front-end in Rails**

https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/evolution-user-experience/  
User Experience (UX) is evolving rapidly, and as designers, we need to ensure our knowledge keeps pace with the changes. This article, the first in a series of ten sponsored by Adobe XD, gets the ball rolling, exploring how UX is evolving. 另附：[Welcome To The Next Level Of Mobile App Development](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/next-level-mobile-app-development/)
